HEADLINE: FAA type certifies P&W engine

BYLINE: Michael Allen

BODY:

The United States' civil aviation authority has certified the engine type that
will power Japan's upcoming jet aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration type certified the PurePower Geared Turbofan
PW1200G engine manufactured by Pratt & Whitney.

The engine will power the MRJ-70 and MRJ-90 variants of the Mitsubishi Regional
Jet (MRJ).

The engine was optimised specifically for the MRJ programme, which in turn
designed the wing and aerodynamics with the PW1200G in mind, Mitsubishi Aircraft
Corporation and Pratt & Whitney say in a joint statement.

"The engines' advanced technology will contribute to a 10-20% reduction in
operating costs compared to the current generation of regional aircraft and 50%
lower in regulated emissions, enabling the MRJ to offer best-in-class efficiency
and environmental performance," the companies say.

Airfinance Journal reported on 27 April that Mitsuibishi Aircraft had finalised
a licencing agreement withPEMCO World Air Services (PEMCO) as its preferred MRO
service provider for the MRJ.

HEADLINE: Fear of China creep as Hong Kong democrats stall lessor tax bill

BYLINE: Michael Allen

BODY:

Filibustering by pan-democratic lawmakers has delayed the passage of a bill to
reduce tax for aircraft lessors in Hong Kong.

Supporters of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) No. 2 Bill had hoped it would pass
in the Legislative Counsel (LegCo) this morning (22 June).

Although the bill was voted in for a third reading, a group of legislators
continued to raise objections during that reading and, after a heated four-hour
session, LegCo president Andrew Leung announced that discussions would resume on
Wednesday 28 June.

Yesterday (21 June), legislators approved the second reading of the bill and
discussed amendments for nearly seven hours.

This morning, Raymond Chan Chi-chuen (???), People Power representative for New
Territories East, said the bill presented a "risky proposition".

"You are just trying to cut prices to compete with the next shop," he said,
referring to competition with Ireland and Singapore.

"Will Ireland and Singapore stay put...and do nothing to regain the leading
edge? If they reduce their tax rate to under 8%, will we be presented with
another bill next year saying the bill will be cut further to 5%?" he asked.

Claudia Mo, Civic Party representative of Kowloon West, complained of "official
toadies" who would adopt the bill "to please their masters in Beijing".

"I'm fairly convinced this is part of some mainlandisation campaign here as
conducted by the government," she said.

"This is to make sure Hong Kong will become even more dependent on
China&hellip;[so that] tiny Hong Kong should learn to eat crumbs on the masters'
table, to learn the place where it stands in the big scheme of things," she
added.

'Mainlandisation' is a term used to describe a perceived encroachment of Chinese
mainland culture into Hong Kong. Mo has previously introduced an
'anti-mainlandisation' bill into the LegCo - without success.

Eddie Chu Hoi-dick (???) argued that the environmental impact of the bill had
not received sufficient consideration. He said that although the bill would not
directly impact Hong Kong's environment, it would contribute to aviation growth
and therefore climate change.

"In the eyes of the government, the aviation industry will only bring about
income. But in fact the expansion of the aviation industry will aggravate
climate change both for us and the world at large," he said.

He added that unless the bill could be proven to benefit "grassroots" Hong
Kongers, it should not be passed.

In support of the bill, Felix Chung Kwok-pan (???), Liberal Party legislator
representing the Textiles and Garment constituency, said that Hong Kong has
offered tax concessions to other industries in the past, and these had proven
beneficial to the city.

"Some members think [the bill] would create a bad precedent. I don't think so.
We've already offered tax concessions to other sectors such as wine trading that
is subject to duty. Now Hong Kong is a trading hub for wine in Asia," he says.

"If [aircraft lessors] come to Hong Kong they will create jobs, promote our
economy - and tax revenue will grow. If you hire people, these employees have to
pay tax as well&hellip;If the new tax incentive is offered it would certainly
attract more emerging industries to come to Hong Kong."

William Ho, a partner at Berwin Leighton Paisner who has promoted the bill and
on Wednesday and Thursdaywatched proceedings from the public gallery, tells
Airfinance Journal he is confident the bill will pass.

Dewey Yee, a member of the Working Group on Transportation of the Economic
Development Commission, which helped formulate the bill, says: "The delay is not
unexpected and our collective patience will prevail."

Political context

Hong Kong's legislative politics is divided into two camps: pro-establishment
and pan-democratic. The former (also known as the pro-China or pro-Beijing camp)
consists of parties which generally support the policies of the Beijing
government towards Hong Kong; the latter (also known as the pro-democracy camp)
generally supports increased democracy and the introduction of universal
suffrage in the Chief Executive election.

HEADLINE: Upbeat Economic Data Leads To Higher Close On Wall Street - US
Commentary

BODY:

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - Stocks moved mostly higher over the course of the
trading session on Thursday, offsetting the weakness seen in the two previous
sessions. With the advance on the day, the three major averages reached new
record closing highs.

The major averages ended the session at their best levels of the day. The Dow
rose 135.53 points or 0.7% to 21,144.18, the Nasdaq advanced 48.31 points or
0.8% to 6,246.83 and the S&P 500 climbed 18.26 points or 0.8% to 2,430.06.

The strength on Wall Street came following the release of some upbeat economic
data, including a report from payroll processor ADP showing a jump in private
sector employment in the month of May.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 253,000 jobs in May after climbing
by a revised 174,000 jobs in April.

Economists had expected an increase of about 185,000 jobs compared to the
addition of 177,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The Institute for Supply Management also released a report showing activity in
the manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a slightly faster rate in the
month of May.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index inched up to 54.9 in May from 54.8 in
April, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector.
Economists had expected the index to edge down to 54.5.

Meanwhile, a separate report from the Labor Department showed that first-time
claims for US unemployment benefits rose by more than expected in the week ended
May 27th.

The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 248,000, an increase of 13,000
from the previous week's revised level of 235,000. Economists had expected
jobless claims to edge up to 239,000.

The Commerce Department also released a report showing that construction
spending unexpectedly tumbled by 1.4% in April.

Late in the session, President Donald Trump announced his widely anticipated
decision to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate accord that seeks to reduce
carbon emissions and slow the effects of climate change.

Sector News

Networking stocks showed a strong move to the upside on the day, driving the
NYSE Arca Networking Index up by 3.3%. With the jump, the index reached its best
closing level in over a month.

Ciena (CIEN) led the networking sector higher, surging up by 15.8% after
reporting better than expected second quarter results.

Significant strength was also visible among biotechnology stocks, as reflected
by the 2.3% gain posted by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index. XBiotech (XBIT)
and Minerva Neurosciences (NERV) posted standout gains.

Telecom, financial, housing and internet stocks also saw considerable strength,
moving higher along with most of the other major sectors.

Other Markets

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a
mixed performance during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up
by 1.1%, while China's Shanghai Composite Index fell by 0.5%.

Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While
the French CAC 40 Index advanced by 0.7%, the German DAX Index and the UK's FTSE
100 Index rose by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.

In the bond market, treasuries gave back ground after trending higher in recent
sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves
opposite of its price, climbed by 2.1 basis points to 2.217%.

Looking Ahead

The Labor Department's monthly jobs report is likely to be in focus on Friday,
as the data could have a significant impact on the outlook for interest rates.

Employment is expected to increase by 185,000 jobs in May after jumping by
211,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.4%.

HEADLINE: European Environment Agency: EU Greenhouse Gas Emissions Up In 2015

BODY:

STOCKHOLM (Alliance News) - Emissions of greenhouse gases in EU member states
increased slightly in 2015, mainly due to a rise in road transport, the bloc's
environmental agency said Thursday.

The European Environment Agency (EAA) estimated a 0.5% rise compared to 2014,
marking the first annual increase since 2010.

The Copenhagen-based agency said improved fuel efficiency was not sufficient "to
counter the effects of an increasing demand for transport" for goods and
passengers.

Another factor was higher demand for heating as the winter was slightly colder
compared to 2014.

Road transport accounted for about 20% of the bloc's total greenhouse gas
emissions. Emissions from that sector rose by 1.6%.

The agency said about 70% of the increase was attributed to passenger cars, 20%
from trucks, 4 per cent from smaller trucks, and 1% from motorcycles.

Aviation emissions, which account for about 4% of the EU's total emissions,
increased by 3.3% in 2015.

Overall, the EEA said the increase was slight "despite the strongest annual
economic growth (2.2%) in the EU since 2007."

The bloc has already achieved its 2020 target of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by 20%.

Between 1990 and 2015 the decrease was 22.1%.

The agency said Spain, Italy and the Netherlands accounted for the largest
increases in greenhouse gas emissions.

HEADLINE: TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Manufacturing Growth Slips And House Prices Slide

BODY:

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories
Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Barclays said it has increased the size of the stake in its African division it
will sell, due to strong investor demand. Barclays will now sell 285.7 million
shares in Barclays Africa Group at a price of ZAR132.0 per share, representing a
34% stake in the division. That is an increase from the initial size of the
placing. Barclays had said late Wednesday that it would sell 187 million shares.
The bigger sale will raise gross sale proceeds of ZAR37.71 billion, and produce
a pro-forma increase of 27 basis points to Barclays' CET1 ratio from 12.5%. The
gross proceeds are equal to around GBP2.22 billion, Barclays said.


----------
Lloyds Banking Group said it has completed the acquisition of MBNA from Bank Of
America. Lloyds first agreed to the purchase of the credit card business for
GBP1.90 billion in December last year, and marks its first acquisition since its
government bailout in the 2008 financial crisis.
----------
Platinum and specialty chemicals company Johnson Matthey said profit rose 19% in
its recently completed financial year, as its underlying performance beat
expectations and it raised its annual dividend 5%. Johnson Matthey said revenue
in the year to the end of March rose 12% to GBP12.03 billion from GBP10.71
billion the year before. On a reported basis, pretax profit in the year totalled
GBP461.6 million, up 19% from GBP386.3 million in financial 2016. The dividend
for the year was increased by 5% to 75.0 pence from 71.5p.
----------
Micro Focus International said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's software
business saw first-half revenue fall while operating profit increased. The
company is currently in the process of merging with US-based HPE's software
business in a deal worth about GBP6.60 billion. Micro Focus reported that HPE's
software unit generated revenue for the six months ended 30 April of USD1.40
billion, down 10% from USD1.55 billion the year before. It declined 5.0% when
adjusted for currency translation and divestitures. Interim operating profit
climbed to USD335.0 million from USD328.0 million, and its profit margin rose to
23.8% from 21.1%.
----------
James and Lachlan Murdoch have held secret talks with UK communications
regulator Ofcom in a bid to persuade the regulator to wave through Twenty-First
Century Fox's planned GBP11.70 billion takeover of Sky, the Telegraph reported.
The Telegraph said it understands that Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom,
met with the two Murdoch brothers in London in the last week to discuss the
proposed deal. Rupert Murdoch, their father, was not present.
----------
Transport operator Firstgroup said annual profit jumped by more than one-third
in its recently ended financial year, and said that while opportunities remain
in North America, uncertainty continues to linger over its UK arm. The UK and
North American transport operator said revenue in the year to the end of March
rose 8.3% to GBP5.65 billion from GBP5.21 billion the year before. However,
revenue was down 0.5% year-on-year at constant currency. Pretax profit for the
year was up 34% from the prior year at GBP152.6 million from GBP113.5 million.
No dividend was paid for the year, but the policy will be continue to be

Group International, as an issuer. Any notes issued by the wholly-owned
subsidiary under the programme will be guaranteed by the London-listed firm.
----------

----------

OIL (Brent): up at USD51.01 a barrel (USD50.29)

(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Theresa May is urging voters to back her plans for Brexit amid further signs of
trouble in her general election campaign. The prime minister, who was ridiculed
by opponents after refusing to take part in a major TV debate on Tuesday night,
will suggest there could be a "brighter future" for the UK if there is a good
deal with the European Union. Jeremy Corbyn, her opponent in the race for Number
10, will also be campaigning on Brexit, buoyed by an opinion poll which
suggested the Tory lead had been reduced to just three points. The YouGov poll
for The Times put the Tories on 42%, down one point since the end of last week,
with Labour up three on 39% and the Liberal Democrats down two points on 7%
level with Ukip.
----------
The UK manufacturing sector growth moderated in May from a three-year high,
survey results from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &
Supply showed. The factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 56.7 in May from
57.3 in April. Nonetheless, the score was above the expected level of 56.5 and
signalled an improvement in conditions for the tenth consecutive month.
Manufacturing production and new orders both expanded at above survey average
rates in May. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
UK house prices declined for the third consecutive month for the first time
since 2009, data from Nationwide Building Society showed. House prices dropped
unexpectedly by 0.2% month-on-month in May, following a 0.4% drop in April.
Economists had forecast prices to rise 0.2%. Providing further evidence that
housing market is losing momentum, house price growth slowed to 2.1% from 2.6%
in the previous month. This was the weakest growth in almost four years. Prices
were expected to climb 2.4%. "Given the ongoing uncertainties around the UK's
future trading arrangements and the upcoming election, the economic outlook is
unusually uncertain, and housing market trends will depend crucially on
developments in the wider economy," Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief
economist, said.
----------
The euro area manufacturing sector gathered further momentum in May as initially
estimated, final data from IHS Markit and showed. The manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index rose to a 73-month high of 57.0 in May, in line with flash
estimate, from 56.7 in April. The score signalled expansion in each of the past
47 months. Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the best seen for
around six years in May. This led to survey-record job creation, with employment
rising in all of the nations covered for the first time since last November.
----------
Ireland's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in nearly two
years in May, survey figures from IHS Markit showed. the seasonally adjusted
Investec Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in
April.
----------
The manufacturing sector in China swung to contraction in May, the latest survey
from Caixin revealed on Thursday with a manufacturing PMI score of 49.6. That
missed forecasts for a score of 50.1 and was down from 50.3 in April.
----------
The US economy continued to expand at a "moderate or modest" pace in the past
few months, according the Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey. Boston and
Chicago signalled that growth had slowed somewhat to a modest pace since the
prior Beige Book period, while New York indicated that activity had flattened
out. Labour markets continued to tighten, with most Districts citing shortages
across a broadening range of occupations and regions. The report in unlikely to
influence the Fed's upcoming policy meeting. Analysts say the Fed will raise
rates in June and once more before the end of the year.
----------
The EU and China are set to meet for a two-day summit to underline their
commitment to the Paris climate agreement. The Chinese delegation will be led by
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, who will meet with EU Council President Donald Tusk
and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for an informal dinner in the
evening. US President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the accord,
considered the first universal action plan to address global warming and climate
change. The EU and China are also set to discuss trade, investment, security and
defence issues at the summit.
----------
Brazil's central bank decided to reduce its interest rate again by 100 basis
points despite political crisis but hinted that the pace of easing would
moderate at its next meeting. The monetary policy committee, known as Copom,
unanimously decided to slash its Selic rate by one percentage point to 10.25%
from 11.25%. The rate was lowered by 100 basis points at its April meeting. The
bank had started easing in October 2016 after inflation showed signs of easing.
----------
Afghanistan's spy agency has blamed the insurgent group Haqqani network and
neighbouring Pakistan for the massive truck bombing in which around 90 people
were killed in Kabul on Wednesday. "The plan for [Wednesday's] attack was drawn
up by the Haqqani network with direct coordination and cooperation from
Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence," the National Directorate of Security
said in a statement late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: German Chancellor Hosts Chinese Prime Minister Ahead Of G20 Summit

BODY:

BERLIN (Alliance News) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Prime
Minister Li Keqiang were holding bilateral talks in Berlin on Thursday in an
effort to shape the agenda ahead of a G20 summit taking place in Hamburg next
month.

Later on Thursday, Li will travel to Brussels for the annual EU-China summit,
where he will meet top EU officials to discuss issues including trade,
greenhouse gas emissions and North Korea's missile tests.

The meeting comes a day after Merkel hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Merkel has been trying to play down any notions that she plans to pivot away
from the US in the wake of an impasse on climate change and towards other
powers.

The G20 summit will take place in the northern German port city of Hamburg on
July 7 and 8.

HEADLINE: European Shares Broadly Higher; Banks Underperform

BODY:

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks were broadly higher

HEADLINE: LONDON BRIEFING: Pound Slips As UK Election Race Narrows To 3 Points

BODY:

LONDON (Alliance News) - Large- and mid-cap London shares were higher early
Thursday, as the pound retreated back below USD1.29 and oil prices rallied.

Theresa May is urging voters to back her plans for Brexit amid further signs of
trouble in her general election campaign.



The UK prime minister, who was ridiculed by opponents after refusing to take
part in a major TV debate on Wednesday night, will suggest there could be a
"brighter future" for the UK if there is a good deal with the European Union.

Jeremy Corbyn, her opponent in the race for Number 10, will also be campaigning
on Brexit, buoyed by an opinion poll which suggested the Tory lead had been
reduced to just three points.

The YouGov poll for The Times put the Tories on 42%, down one point since the
end of last week, with Labour up three on 39% and the Liberal Democrats down two
points on 7% level with Ukip.

Meanwhile, the UK economy was showing some ill effects of the political
uncertainty. UK house prices declined for the third consecutive month for the
first time since 2009, data from Nationwide Building Society showed Thursday.

UK house prices declined for the third consecutive month for the first time
since 2009, data from Nationwide Building Society showed. House prices dropped
unexpectedly by 0.2% month-on-month in May, following a 0.4% drop in April.
Economists had forecast prices to rise 0.2%. Providing further evidence that
housing market is losing momentum, house price growth slowed to 2.1% from 2.6%
in the previous month. This was the weakest growth in almost four years. Prices
were expected to climb 2.4%. "Given the ongoing uncertainties around the UK's
future trading arrangements and the upcoming election, the economic outlook is
unusually uncertain, and housing market trends will depend crucially on
developments in the wider economy," Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief
economist, said.
----------
Ireland's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in nearly two
years in May, survey figures from IHS Markit showed. the seasonally adjusted
Investec Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in
April. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
The manufacturing sector in China swung to contraction in May, the latest survey
from Caixin revealed on Thursday with a manufacturing PMI score of 49.6. That
missed forecasts for a score of 50.1 and was down from 50.3 in April.
----------
The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in May, and at a faster
rate, the latest survey from Nikkei revealed on Thursday with a manufacturing
PMI score of 53.1. That's up from 52.7 in April.
----------
The US economy continued to expand at a "moderate or modest" pace in the past
few months, according the Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey. Boston and
Chicago signaled that growth had slowed somewhat to a modest pace since the
prior Beige Book period, while New York indicated that activity had flattened
out. Labor markets continued to tighten, with most Districts citing shortages
across a broadening range of occupations and regions. The report in unlikely to
influence the Fed's upcoming policy meeting. Analysts say the Fed will raise
rates in June and once more before the end of the year.
----------
The EU and China are set to meet for a two-day summit to underline their
commitment to the Paris climate agreement. The Chinese delegation will be led by
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, who will meet with EU Council President Donald Tusk
and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for an informal dinner in the
evening. US President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the accord,
considered the first universal action plan to address global warming and climate
change. The EU and China are also set to discuss trade, investment, security and
defence issues at the summit.
----------
Brazil's central bank decided to reduce its interest rate again by 100 basis
points despite political crisis but hinted that the pace of easing would
moderate at its next meeting. The monetary policy committee, known as Copom,
unanimously decided to slash its Selic rate by one percentage point to 10.25%
from 11.25%. The rate was lowered by 100 basis points at its April meeting. The
bank had started easing in October 2016 after inflation showed signs of easing.
----------
Afghanistan's spy agency has blamed the insurgent group Haqqani network and
neighbouring Pakistan for the massive truck bombing in which around 90 people
were killed in Kabul on Wednesday. "The plan for [Wednesday's] attack was drawn
up by the Haqqani network with direct coordination and cooperation from
Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence," the National Directorate of Security
said in a statement late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: EU And China To Stress Commitment To Paris Climate Deal At Summit

BODY:

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The EU and China are set to met on Thursday for a
two-day summit to underline their commitment to the Paris climate agreement.

The Chinese delegation will be led by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, who will meet
with EU Council President Donald Tusk and EU Commission President Jean-Claude

US President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the accord, considered
the first universal action plan to address global warming and climate change.

The EU and China are also set to discuss trade, investment, security and defence
issues at the summit.

Both sides are committed to pursuing closer trade ties on paper, but European
companies say they are finding it more difficult to conduct business in China
than before. Some have accused the Chinese government of limiting their access
to the market in favour of domestic firms.

The EU is China's biggest trading partner.

HEADLINE: EU's Juncker Warns Trump Against US Quitting Paris Climate Deal

BODY:

Berlin (Alliance News) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on
Wednesday warned US President Donald Trump against withdrawing from the Paris
agreement on climate change.

"I'm a trans-Atlanticist," he said at a debate in Berlin on the future of
Europe. "But if in the coming hours or days the American president said that he
wanted to withdraw from the Paris Accord, it's Europe's duty to say, 'It doesn't
work like that.'"

Trump is to announce his decision on the climate deal, which aims to cut
greenhouse gas emissions, on Thursday, amid reports that he is set to pull the
US out.

The White House has declined to comment on those reports, with spokesman Sean
Spicer saying only that Trump would make it clear in the "next few days."

Juncker pointed out that climate change was putting 83 countries at risk of
disappearing from the map as sea levels rise.

"It's not just about the future of humanity in Europe, above all it's about the
future of humanity elsewhere," he said.

He also warned Trump that it might not be as easy as he thinks to withdraw from
the treaty. In fact it would take Washington three to four years to pull out, he
said, adding that the idea the US could simply "disappear" from the deal was
incorrect.

"Not everything written in law and not everything written in international
agreements is 'fake news,'" Juncker continued. "You have to stick to them."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong fines four importers for hazardous e-waste

BYLINE: Brad MacAulay



HIGHLIGHT: Hong Kong has sent a message to recyclers that it will prosecute
violators of its e-waste laws who attempt to send illegal imports into or
transshipments through the territory.

 BODY:

PITTSBURGH "" Hong Kong has sent a message to recyclers that it will prosecute
violators of its e-waste laws who attempt to send illegal imports into or
transshipmentsthrough the territory.    Four importers from the United States,
United Kingdom, Japan and mainland China were convicted and fined a total of
$94,000 for breaking the territory's Waste Disposal Ordinance by illegally
shipping hazardous electronic waste into the country, the government stated in a
June 20 release. The names of the companies were not disclosed.    Hong Kong's
Customs and Excise Department, alongside the Environmental Protection
Department, intercepted 10 containers last November and December. The
containers""which were intended for import into Hong Kong or transshipment to
Singapore and mainland China""were found to have been full of hazardous e-waste
valued at $630,000, including flat panel displays, batteries, circuit boards and
toner cartridges.    Each of the containers was rejected and immediately
returned to its respective country of origin, and Hong Kong's Environmental
Protection Department notified relevant local enforcement agencies.    In Hong
Kong, it is illegal for anyone to import, transship or export hazardous waste
without valid permits.    First-time offenders are liable for a maximum fine of
$200,000 and six months'imprisonment, while repeat offenders face a maximum fine
of $500,000 and two years'imprisonment.    Brad MacAulay  bmacaulay@amm.com

HEADLINE: Manufacturers mixed on Paris climate exit

BYLINE: Nat Rudarakanchana



HIGHLIGHT: Metals and mining companies offered mixed reactions to President
Donald Trump's decision to exit the global Paris Agreement under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with one notable miner lauding
the withdrawal.

 BODY:

NEW YORK "" Metals and mining companies offered mixed reactions to President
Donald Trump's decision to exit the global Paris Agreement under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with one notableminer lauding
the withdrawal.    "We must understand that staying in the accord is not
equivalent to protecting the environment. As a nation, we could no longer accept
the restrictions imposed on the United States while other countries are allowed
to continue to pollute the world,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. chairman,
president and chief executive officer Lourenco Goncalves said on June 1.    The
climate accord is a "bad deal for America in its current form," he said.

The U.S. iron and steel industry is the "most environmentally compliant among
the major industrial nations," Goncalves continued, noting thatAmerican
producers exclusively use iron ore pellets in blast furnaces, compared with
China's use of "highly polluting" sinter feed iron ore fines from Australia and
Brazil.    Goncalves often contrasts the pollution caused by sinter fines with
the environmental friendliness of iron ore pellets, which Cleveland-based
Cliffs""the biggest independent U.S. iron ore miner by output""produces and
sells to North American steelmakers.    "We believe that being pro-environment,
pro-industry and pro-business are not contradictory goals," he said.    However,
top trading company Cargill Inc. blasted the announcement, describing this move
as "extremely disappointing."    "Exiting international accords like the Paris
agreement will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our
environment and relationships amongst the world community. And it positions the
U.S. as an outlier on this important issue," Cargill chairman and CEO David
MacLennan said.    Further, the pact actually would have grown the U.S. economy
and created jobs, he said. "Caring about sustainability of the planet is not
only the right thing to do for people and the environment, it is also good
business," MacLennan argued.    Minneapolis-based Cargill handles 5 million
tonnes of carbon steel and 40 million tonnes of iron ore globally each year, in
addition to operating seven U.S. steel service centers, according to its
website.    Complying with the Paris accord and its restrictions would have cost
the U.S. 2.7 million jobs by 2025, as well as significant lost production in
iron ore, steel, coal and natural gas, according to White House releases. And
Trump has said that the accord burdens the U.S. unfairly compared with other
countries like China.    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator
Scott Pruitt hailed the move as a "historic restoration of American economic
independence," in joint prepared remarks.    Other steel and metals associations
did not immediately comment on the withdrawal.    On the same day as Trump
issued his decision, theWashington-based American Iron and Steel Institute
(AISI) released its 2017 policy book, which outlines the state of steel as the
industry relates to various issues""including the environment.    The U.S. has
the lowest energy intensity of any major steelmaking nation, and has cut
greenhouse gas intensity by 36 percent since 1990, the policy book said. Overall
energy intensity has been cut by 31 percent since 1990.    Still, steelmaking
consumes "substantial" electricity, natural gas, coal and coke, AISI noted.
Last year, U.S. raw steel output fromelectric-arc furnaces (EAFs) was more than
double that of blast furnaces""at 68.6 and 31.4 percent of total production,
respectively""according to the latest U.S. Geological Survey data. EAFs are less
energy-intensive than blast furnaces and emit fewer carbon emissions, as they
make steel from scrap.    Nat Rudarakanchana  nat.rudy@amm.com

HEADLINE: US' Paris accord exit "~free lunch' for China

BYLINE: Kirk Maltais



HIGHLIGHT: The United States' exit from the global Paris Agreement under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change could prove to be
politically beneficial for the Chinese government and provide the country
freedom to continue business as usual with its aluminum production.

 BODY:

NEW YORK "" The United States' exitfrom the global Paris Agreement under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change could prove to be
politically beneficial for the Chinese governmentandprovide the country freedom
to continue business as usual with its aluminum production.     "This is a free
lunch for them. What really changes for them internally? Not much," John
Mothersole, director of research, pricing and purchasing service at London-based
IHS Markit Ltd., told AMM on June 2.     What President Donald Trump's exit from
the accord does is provide an opening for Chinese president Xi Jinping with an
opening to establish its voice as the leader of climate-based initiatives,
Mothersole said.

And on the aluminum side, the country doesn't have to deviate from its current
course of replacing higher-polluting and lower efficiency capacity with cleaner
but higher-producing operations, all while appearing to lead on the issue of
curbing carbon emissions.    While China's monthlyproduction of primary
aluminumhas dipped slightly since the start of 2017""to 2.77 million tonnes in
April from 2.95 million tonnes in January""it's still up7.7 percent from almost
2.57 million tonnes in April 2016, data from the International Aluminum
Institute (IAI) show. These elevated levelsmay not come down through the
second-half of the year, Mothersole said.    "I'm beginning to think that while
cuts may be coming, what Chinese producers are doing is trying to establish a
high ceiling now from which to cut later," Mothersole said. "This may satisfy
government mandates, but the market may end up being better supplied going into
(the fourth quarter) than the consensus has it right now."     Other experts
agree that the move creates an opening for another player on the world stage to
step into the vacuum that Trump has created, and whether or not that player is
sympathetic to U.S. interests remains to be seen.     "In terms of the optics,
there is no doubt that America is receding in the rear vision mirror. Goodbye
America," said AZ China Ltd. managing director Paul Adkins in a June 2 posting
on the company's website. "Whether the space created by Trump's retreat is
filled by President Xi, Angela Merkel or Emmanuel Macron or someone else remains
to be seen."    Adkins does agree that the change in dynamic will likely mean
little for the country's modus operandi in aluminum.    "For aluminum, Trump's
decision probably means little," Adkins said. "China makes 55 percent of the
world's aluminum, but if one were able to measure these things on some sort of
scale, it could be argued that China accepts well below 55 percent of the
responsibility for the environment."     In the first half of the year,
optimismthat China will actually stick with promises to cut capacity helped push
aluminum prices up, with the three-month aluminum contract on the London Metal
Exchangehitting a more than two-year high of $1,972 per tonne (89.5 cents per
pound) on April 5.     Heightened prices have been the cause for speculation
thatsome capacitycould come back online in the U.S., including the curtailed
smelter in New Madrid, Mo.,purchased from now-defunct Noranda Aluminum Holding
Corp. by Arg International AG for $13.7 million last year.     Other metals and
mining companies have lauded Trump for the move, with top U.S. iron ore miner
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. on June 1 calling the climate accord a "bad deal
for America in its current form."    In a tweet accompanying a video clip of his
June 1 speech, Trump said that his "job as president is to do everything within
my power to give America a level playing field."    Kirk Maltais

HEADLINE: Cafe rollback could slow EV development

BYLINE: Millicent Dent

BODY:

NEW YORK ""The potential relaxation of corporate average fuel economy (Cafe)
standards, among other regulation rollbacks, could slow the introduction of
electric vehicles (EVs) into the market, according to an industry expert.
"You move the goal post and consequently move the urgency. It doesn't go away,
but the urgency to implement is deferred," Mike Rayne, managing director at FTI
Consulting Inc., told AMM.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
announced on March 15 that agency administrator Scott Pruitt would review prior
administrations' finalization of Cafe standards through 2025 and determine if
those should be modified.

If the standards are relaxed or removed, Rayne predictedthat EVs' rate of
introduction into the market would slow""but not stop.    Cafe standards are
currently driving automotive companies to produce electric vehicles. Without
those, "things will slow down a little bit," Rayne said, butit's unlikely car
companies would abandon the electric vehicle market altogether.     For one, it
takes car companies and suppliers about five years to develop and implement
newtechnology. Since automakers have already begun developing electric vehicles,
it's unlikely they will be willing to change course.     Rayne compared the auto
industry to a large supertanker, saying "it's difficult to change direction
quickly." Dismantling the infrastructure that's already been put in place for
electric vehicles doesn't make sense.     "At the end of the day, there's
inertia in the industry to continue producing those vehicles," Rayne said. Plus,
"administrations come and go. If the Cafe standards were rolled back and
incentives removed, how long would that last?" Companies don't want to fall
behind the curve if the next administration reintroduces the standards.
Consumer interest in sustainable manufacturing is another driving force for EV
automakers, Rayne noted.    Car companies "want to remain "~green' certainly
from the perspective of the buying public. There's a percentage of the
population that would see electric vehicles as a plus."    Environmentally
focused individuals want the option to choose a vehicle that pollutes less,
although Rayne admitted"that group of people only makes up a small percentage of
the public."    A large portion of the population "is not self-motivated enough
to seek fuel-efficient vehicles because they're available," he said.    Electric
vehicles are already on the market, but consumers are still choosing to go with
cheaper and bigger models. Many people are turned off by the prospect of paying
hundreds of dollars more for a vehicle that produces 10 percent less carbon
dioxide, Rayne said. Instead, most see a better value in paying extra for a
vehicle that provides greater safety, connectivity and on- and off-road
traction, among other features.     And lower gas prices give consumers one less
reason to shift to electric vehicles. European countries have been able to do
drive more fuel-efficient technologies by taxing fuel, according to Rayne. Gas
in Europe costs approximately three times as much as in the United States,
making it a "fairly substantial portion of monthly expenses."    According to
Rayne,"the only way to (drive EV usage)is either through tax credits or ... by
implementing legislation that forces car companies to change the cars that are
available."    The Trump administration has not yet made clear whether it plans
to scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit on zero-emissions vehicles, but that
wouldn't be a surprising move, Rayne said, given the rhetoric on rolling back
regulations.     Such incentives "ensure electric vehicles are affordable. If
federal tax credits are removed, regardless of what happens to the Cafe
standards, that makes it tougher for vehicles to get sales penetration in the
market," Rayne said.    The current regulatory uncertainty poses a challenge for
car companies developing electric vehicles."It's a difficult period for the
automotive industry," he said. "Previous administrations were clear that Cafe
standards were going to happen. Now it's a disruptive period."     Millicent

HEADLINE: Consumers wary of supply chain risks: From

BYLINE: Millicent Dent

BODY:

NEW YORK ""Consumers are becoming increasingly focused on overall supply
channels in an effort to mitigate risk from unforeseen disturbances, according
to the president and chief executive officer of Central Wire Industries Ltd.
"More of our customer base and the end-users we sell to are
(increasingly)concerned about security in the supply channel, the country of
origin and our ability to audit the supply channel," Paul From told AMM. "Our
suppliers may be on time, we may be on time, but it depends on who (our
supplier's supplier) is."    From firstnoticed the heightened sense of awareness
about eight to 10 months ago, a change he attributed to a combination of
factors""primarily recent events that demonstrated how vulnerable supply chains
are to outside influence.

One incident that roiled the supply chain was the August 2016 bankruptcy of
Seoul, South Korea-based shipping giant Hanjin Shipping Co. Ltd., which crippled
Hanjin's global shipping operations overnight as ports worldwide refused to
allow its containers to dock. "People realized there's real vulnerability that's
outside of our control," he said.    Another concern is Brexit, which has led to
"people wondering what other changes could take place in the market that might
move supply channels around."  Still, From welcomes the increased focus from
consumers due to Central Wire's cultivation of a "small and very actively
managed supplier base."    Central Wire is "continuously monitoring suppliers.
We're really digging asdeeply as possible to make sure we're rock solid," From
said, adding that the wire manufacturer rarely switches suppliers.    The Perth,
Ontario-basedcompany also expects to benefit from increased manufacturing in the
United States under President Donald Trump. The majority of Central Wire's
suppliers are located in the U.S. and are now investing in their operations
there rather than abroad, according to From.     "Companies that have
reconsidered investments or thought strategically along the lines of what the
new administration is looking for in terms of turning back to the United States
has been a positive for us," From said, adding that the shift gives both
end-users and distributors more options.     From also supports the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Section 232 investigation into the effect steel imports
have on national security; he expects the probe will benefit end-users and
distributors within the industry."I hope that whatever they decide is fair from
the standpoint of reinforcing the fact that more products need to be
manufactured in the United States," From said.     However, From voiced concerns
thatTrump'sdecision to withdraw from the global Paris Agreement under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change would take away the incentive for
companies to invest in technology to reduce greenhouse gases.    "I think the
outlook for nickel would be brighter if the U.S. were to continue with the
climate change accord," he said.For example, the Paris Accord would require coal
plants in the U.S. to develop "cleaner and cleaner ways of producing power.
Those technologies require advances in alloys." Without that objective, From
anticipates reduced demand for stainless steel and nickel-based alloys.    From
was hopeful that companies wouldn't stop investing in green technology, mainly
due to the outcry from numerous cities and states after Trump's announcement. "I
think that innovation drives what we need in terms of consumption of stainless
and nickel alloys."    Countries outside of the United States "might be winners
if they're developing technologies ahead of the U.S. (It) could be something we
miss."     Millicent Dent  millicent.dent@amm.com

HIGHLIGHT: The US Commerce Department might soon issue its findings and
suggested remedies for the Section 232 investigation into steel imports, a top
industry executive said, warning of the potential, significant impact that could
have on the steel market.

 BODY:

NEW YORK "" The US Commerce Department might soon issue its findings and
suggested remedies for the Section 232 investigation into steel imports, a top
industry executive said,warning of the potential, significant impact that could
have on the steel market.    "The report should come very soon," Lourenco
Goncalves, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Cleveland-based
iron ore miner and pellet producer Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., said,
speakingduring a keynote presentation at AMM's Steel Survival Strategies XXXII
conference in New York on June 28.    Action on the steel 232 probe has probably
been delayed, in part because of controversy in the US Senate concerning health
care reform.    But the 232 train has not been derailed by that debacle,
Goncalves stressed.

"This (health care) is delaying things a little bit. But (232) will come. It's
not going away. So prepare for the reality because it will be a lot less
painful."    Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president
can penalize imports if he deems them to be a threat to national security. The
Trump administration has floated the idea of using tariffs, quotas or a
combination of both to curb imports of foreign steel and aluminum.    "Section
232 is powerful. It allows the president of the United States to do pretty much
whatever he wants," Goncalves said.     One rumor circulating through the steel
industry on Wednesday was that Commerce would release its findings in the
Section 232 probe on June 29 and that President Donald Trump would sign off on
remedies to stem imports on July 4. While some sources insisted the rumor had
solid foundations, others dismissed it as a joke.    A Commerce spokesman did
not respond to AMM'srequest for comment on the potential time line and the scope
of the 232.    Goncalves was encouraged by the Trump administration's support
for "Buy American" policies, which he said should benefit some of Cliffs'
clients, and lavished praise on Trump for exiting the global Paris Agreement
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.    "That was a
good one. That was the first time I agreed with president Trump. It felt
strange," he said.    Before the presidential election, Goncalves threw his
support behind Democratic candidate and former secretary of state Hillary
Clinton, saying Trump was "unfit" to be president.    Goncalves criticized the
Paris Agreement for placing restrictions on the United States without imposing
similar restrictions on China until 2030. "I see a lot of people disagreeing
just because they are tree-huggers. But they disagree with a lot of things that
they don't really understand."    Goncalves also lashed out at some Australian
miners for selling low-priced ore to Chinese mills, arguing that cheap raw
materials from Australia were in large part responsible for China's steel glut.
"If you really want to resolve the overcapacity issue, you have to resolve
Australia."    Michael Cowden  mcowden@amm.com

HEADLINE: 232 report said likely on hold until after G-20

BYLINE: Michael Cowden



HIGHLIGHT: The US Commerce Department will probably delay issuing its findings
in a Section 232 investigation into steel imports until after the Group of 20

said.

 BODY:

CHICAGO "" The US Commerce Departmentwill probably delay issuing its findings in
a Section 232 investigation into steel imports until after the Group of 20
(G-20) meeting in Germany, starting July 7, sources familiar with the matter
said.    That means the department probably won't formally decide whether
imports pose a threat to national security, or recommend remedies to curtail
them, until the week of July 10, one source predicted.    "Clearly no. Nothing
is coming until after the G-20," a Washington source commented when asked
whether a report might be issued late on June 30.    A Commerce spokesman did
not respond to AMM'srequest for comment on the timeline of the 232.
Nonetheless, steel remains at the vanguard of the Trump administration's trade
policy, and what the administration decides to do regarding steel imports will
likely provide a taste of what's to come not only for aluminum""for which a
separate 232 probe has been launched""but also for other products, the
Washington source said.

Still, questions remain about the scope of the case, including whether it could
cover semi-finished goods or allow for exemptions by product or country. "We
have received no clear guidance," one trade attorney source toldAMM. "When you
ask people involved in the investigation what the scope is, they simply say
"~steel.'"    The administration will likely use the 232s as a catalyst for
discussions at the G-20 about the problem of global "overproduction," the
Washington source said. The threat of action on the 232 could be used to ratchet
up pressure on other countries to address the issue more swiftly, he said.
Commerce is increasingly using the term "overproduction" instead of
"overcapacity," because while many countries have too much steelmaking capacity,
some have done more than others to keep such excess and unprofitable capacity
idle.    The June 30 deadline also mayhave slipped because the administration
may still be debating which remedy is best, a second Washington source said.
Quotas alone are almost certainly off the table, and discussions probably now
center on whether to go with a broad-based tariff or a mix of quotas and
tariffs.    Commerce has proposed imposing volumes quotas on imports, setting
tariffs or establishing a system that utilizes both.    Tariffs on steel imports
are rumored to be set at 25%, a figure favored by President Donald Trump,
perhaps over the objections of his cabinet, the trade attorney said.    That
amount, which would come on top of anyexisting anti-dumping and countervailing
duties, would benefit US mills more than the other measures, the
secondWashington source said. "Anyone who knows how to run a steel mill would
make money." And they have the added advantage of being easy to sell to both
Trump and his base, he said.    The hybrid mechanism""in which tariffs would
kick in after a volume threshold was reached""might not appeal to Trump because
they are more complicated and would require more resources to implement.
However, it would be less disruptive to steel consumers and to US allies and
trading partners, the second source noted.    Some market participants and
Washington sources have criticized the administration for repeatedly
telegraphing that a decision in the steel 232 would be reached by the end of
June, only to miss that self-imposed deadline.     Still, Trump would have
risked being a pariah at the G-20 summit if he had rolled out big tariffs after
leaving the global Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change""an unpopular move globally""and that may have played into the
delay as well, the secondsource said.    Michael Cowden  mcowden@amm.com

Agency) on 31 May

Ulan Bator: Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Mongolian government on
Wednesday [31 May] launched a project worth 500,000 dollars to help Mongolian

Paris agreement

Chinese state commentaries have warned that the US will be setting a "very bad
example" if it were to leave the Paris climate agreement.

Online outlets in China carried detailed reports on the "imminent" decision from
the White House over the deal. Some also highlighted Elon Musk's vow to quit as
US President Donald Trump's advisor if the country were to pull out of the deal.

"The agreement is the symbol of the fragile and rare trend that humanity is
joining forces for a biding solution to climate change," The Global Times paper
said in an editorial. "The US will be dealing a violent blow to this trend if it
leaves the Paris agreement. Washington will also be leading the trend to push
the world backwards," it added.

Meanwhile, China and the EU are said to be preparing a joint statement in
support of the Paris climate change accord.

The news comes as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is set to attend an annual EU-China
summit. Financial portal Caixin also highlighted US reports that China and the
EU will vow "closer climate change cooperation" in the joint statement expected
after the meeting.

China cyber-security law

China's widely watched cyber-security law takes effect from today. (See
Monitoring's Explainer: https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/#/product/c1di1478)

Foreign firms fear the new law will restrict their freedom to do business in the
country and will give authorities more control over them but China's
cybersecurity watchdog said the law is not meant to limit the cross-border flow
of information or hamper international trade.

The new law is the first comprehensive measure taken by China to ensure data
protection and cyber-security at the national level.

US missile system test

Chinese state commentaries said the US will provoke "greater response" from
Beijing and Moscow after it tested its defence system against intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

The Global Times said the US' drill is "not a simple test" as the defence system
can also be used to guard against missiles from China and Russia.

"The US has been spending tens of billions of dollars annually to develop
defence systems against ballistic missiles," the paper said in an editorial.
"But such defence systems will always become beaten by even more sophisticated
ballistic missiles," it added.

Chinese premier visits Germany

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in
Germany has called on both countries to work together to "offset global
uncertainties" and to continue to consolidate mutual trust.

Official Xinhua News Agency welcomed the meeting, noting common interests
between China and the EU. "There is no silver bullet for the unavoidable trade
spats between China and the EU," it said in a commentary. "However, it's
reasonable for them to keep in mind that their common interests far outweigh
differences, which helps make right decisions."

The Global Times further called on the EU to end an arms embargo on China. "Some
EU states, for instance, France and Germany, have been urging that the ban
should be lifted in an attempt to get more opportunities in the Chinese market,"
the commentary said.

Chinese activist detention

Most mainstream Chinese outlets appeared to have ignored the detention of an
activist who has been probing alleged workers' rights abuses at a supplier for
Ivanka Trump's shoe brand.

Hua Haifeng was working undercover for the US-based China Labour Watch which
said he had witnessed examples of forced overtime and wage violations.

The story does not appear to be censored on Chinese social media. The topic has
drawn attention from some users who paid tribute to Hua on popular microblogging
site Sina Weibo.

Social Buzz

Indian Bollywood movie Dangal continued to trend on Chinese social media with
users sharing pictures of lead actor Aamir Khan working out to gain weight for
one part of the movie before losing weight again for another part. Users on
popular microblogging site Sina Weibo applauded his professionalism.

China marked Children's Day today with social media users sharing pictures from
their childhood on their accounts.

Coming Up

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang travels to Belgium for the 19th China-EU leaders'
meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker.

HEADLINE: China, Taiwan press: Paris agreement, premier visits Europe

BODY:

The following is a selection of quotes from editorials and commentaries carried
in 1 June 2017 website editions of mainland Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwan
newspapers and news portals available to BBC Monitoring. Unless otherwise
stated, the quotes are in Chinese. The figure in brackets after the quote
indicates the date of publication on the website.

Paris climate change agreement

Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a joint statement on the Paris climate
agreement saying it is "an imperative more important than ever". It will be
widely seen as a rebuff to the US, as President Donald Trump prepares to
announce on Thursday if the US is withdrawing from the accord.

Headline: "US to set a bad example if it leaves Paris agreement"

Beijing's Huanqiu Shibao (Global Times): "... Humanity remains divided
politically and the UN remains weak, but they have quelled all the problems and
have agreed on a binding agreement on climate change. It is the symbol of the
fragile and rare trend that humanity is joining forces for a binding solution to
climate change. The US will be dealing a violent blow to this trend if it leaves
the Paris agreement. Washington also be leading the trend to push the world
backwards. ... If the US government eventually decides to go about it without
regard for the consequences, it will become the biggest waste of its diplomatic
resources in recent years. It will show the world clearly that the US is selfish
and irresponsible and weaken the US' leadership on the world, which Americans
value very much. ..." (Editorial) (1)

Ties with Europe

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called on China and Germany during a meeting with
Chancellor Angela Merkel to work together to "offset global uncertainties". Li
has also called on the two countries to continue to consolidate mutual trust and
strengthen bilateral cooperation.

Headline: "Common interests far outweigh differences in China-EU relations"

Beijing's Xinhua News Agency in English: "... It's no secret that Li's visit
came at a time when the two giant economies are wrangling over a disputable
surrogate country approach. The EU uses the approach to calculate anti-dumping
measures against Chinese exports by referring to prices or costs of similar
products in a third country. ... There is no silver bullet for the unavoidable
trade spats between China and the EU. However, it's reasonable for them to keep
in mind that their common interests far outweigh differences, which helps make
right decisions." (Commentator's article) (1)

http://bit.ly/2rHgC5V

Headline: "Time to lift EU's outdated arms embargo on China"

Beijing's Global Times in English: "... The arms embargo is a wrong political
decision made to court Washington for economic benefits at the sacrifice of
Beijing. But 28 years have gone by, and the ban is outdated. China has made
great achievements in its political reform, and has no intention to threaten any
country. Some EU states, for instance, France and Germany, have been urging that
the ban should be lifted in an attempt to get more opportunities in the Chinese
market. The EU should overcome its ideological bridle and adopt a more practical
policy. We hope the bloc can move to lift the arms embargo on Beijing as early
as possible. After all, deepening cooperation is mutually beneficial."
(Commentator's article) (1)

Ties with US

The US has for the first time successfully tested its defence system against an
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), say officials. A ground-based
interceptor was launched at a California air base and shot down a mock ballistic
missile, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said. The Pentagon said the test was
long-planned but it comes amid increased tensions with North Korea.

Headline: "Missile defence system works, but US shouldn't be too arrogant"

Beijing's Huanqiu Shibao (Global Times): "... The missile defence system will
not become the 'safety shield' for the US. Between the US and North Korea,
Pyongyang will not give up its ballistic missile programme because of the US'
defence system and subject itself to the US' treatment. China and Russia are
both capable in offensive and defensive missile technologies. The US' drill will
only prompt China and Russia to further upgrade their ballistic missile
technologies to ensure their own technologies continue to lead over the US'
defence system. ..." (Editorial) (1)

http://bit.ly/2qCZluE

Headline: "Who is Trump trying to scare with trans-Pacific shield"

Hong Kong's Oriental Daily: "... It is easy to conclude that the US' shield
works only on paper. The shield's effectiveness relies heavily on satellite and
radar tracking. While China's and Russia's ICBM technologies lag behind that of
the US, they both have sophisticated weapons against satellites. It is obvious
that they will first destroy US satellites in order to paralyse the US defence
shield. ... But for countries trying to develop ICBM technologies, such as North
Korea and Iran, the US shield is destructive. These two countries don't have the
capability to shot down US satellites and therefore cannot effectively damage
the US' missile shield. From this perspective, they will find it difficult to
fire missiles that can penetrate the US' defence system. ..." (Commentator's
article) (1)

New Kenya Railway

A new railway in Kenya built with Chinese investment has entered servicing,
linking the African country's capital Nairobi with port city Mombasa built with
Chinese investment. Officials say the 480-kiliometre railway will cut travel
time between the two cities and will be able to move 25 million tonnes of cargo
every year.

Headline: "Kenya's century-old railway dream fulfilled with 'sincerity'"

Beijing's Xinhua News Agency: www.xinhuanet.com "... The railway has continued
the traditional friendship between China and Africa. Through cooperation between
the two sides, the continent will be able to enjoy an even more comprehensive
traffic network. It is edging closer towards the dream of benefitting its people
through improved connectivity. ..." (Commentator's article) (1)

HEADLINE: China premier begins three-day Europe tour with Germany

BODY:

Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency) on 31 May

Berlin: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived here Wednesday [31 May] for an
official visit to Germany.

Li will join German chancellor Angela Merkel for an annual meeting between the
two heads of government, a mechanism that has been in place since 2004.

Upon arrival, Li said the past 45 years since China and Germany forged
diplomatic ties have seen their relations grow steadily. Against a backdrop of
sluggish world economic recovery as well as rising protectionism and a
de-globalisation trend, the two countries have found it ever more important to
step up communication and cooperation.

"I'm here to consolidate and develop our friendship, and to innovate and upgrade
the bilateral cooperation," Li said. "We are expected to promote bilateral ties
and cooperation to a new high in the spirit of mutual respect and equality, so
as to benefit both peoples and contribute to regional and world stability,
cooperation and development."

During the stay, Li and Merkel will meet on several occasions, witness the
signing of various cooperation documents, meet the press together, attend and
address a forum on innovation cooperation and have a dialogue with business
people from both sides.

The premier will also meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Berlin is the first leg of Li's three-day Europe tour that will also take him to
Belgium.

In Brussels, the Chinese premier will co-chair the 19th China-EU leaders'
meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker, and pay an official visit to Belgium.

It is Li's ninth trip to Europe and third visit to Germany as premier. While
Merkel is a frequent visitor to China, both Juncker and Belgian Prime Minister
Charles Michel visited China last year.

Such frequent high-level exchanges between China and the EU testify the common
grounds and interests shared by the two sides despite an ever-changing
international landscape, and showcase their common desire for cooperation and
development.

The visit took place as Europe has witnessed frequent high-level diplomacy
recently.

During US President Donald Trump's just concluded visit to Europe last week, the
two sides saw their rifts on defence, trade and climate change widened.

Tusk admitted the EU is still at odds with the United States over issues like
climate and trade.

HEADLINE: Pakistan president addresses parliament amid opposition protest

BODY:

Text of report in English by leading English-language Pakistani daily Dawn
website on 1 June

President Mamnoon Hussain on Thursday [1 June] addressed a joint session of
Parliament to mark the beginning of the ruling party's final year in government,
amidst noisy protest from the opposition.

Although protests were in full swing during the earlier part of the president's
speech, the assembly hall quietened down halfway through as the opposition
lawmakers walked out.

Earlier, opposition lawmakers made all-out efforts to disrupt the president's
speech, with whistling, sloganeering and desk thumping, while shouts of "Go
Nawaz Go" and "traitor" rang in the parliament.

The main bone of contention for the opposition is the government's refusal to
broadcast the opposition's budget speeches live on PTV.

PML-N leaders, including the prime minister, however appeared determined to
ignore the protests and expressed their appreciation for the president's speech
by rapping their desks.

session.

The president's speech

President Mamnoon Hussain congratulated the nation on continuation of the
political process.

"For progress and development of the nation, political process should be freed
from the personal interests," he said.

Speaking about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor the president said, "For the
last several decades illogical polices, precious resources have been spoiled.
State friendly policies, joining the region through CPEC and projects of power
generation all are a result of the realisation that the past policies have hit
the country with damages."

The president added that CPEC will bring progress and development for the entire
region.

"With increased per-capita income, Pakistan has become of the largest 25
economies of the world and the economic indicators are positive." President
Mamnoon said during his address.

He also talked about climate change and stressed the need to devise strategy so
as to use experiments, done across the world in this regard.

Talking about Fata and Gilgit-Baltistan, he said that the government has
allocated huge funds to bring these areas as par with the other parts of the
country.

Discussing the ongoing power-crisis in the country, the president said that a
lot of work needs to be done in this regard.

He added that he had suggested last year to utilise Gilgit-Baltistan's resources
in connection with production of electricity.

The president said that infrastructure should be constructed to include
electricity from under construction dames in the area to national grid.

The president also highlighted that issue of Kashmir and bilateral relations
between Pakistan and India.

Terming Kashmir the incomplete agenda of the divide of the subcontinent.

"India has become a major obstacle for bringing in durable peace in the region,"
the president said.

Earlier, a source in the Presidency told Dawn that President Mamnoon Hussain was
well-prepared to face "any untoward situation during the joint session" and he
would continue his speech, even if opposition members tried to disrupt it.

"The president is a head of the state and he should not be targeted for
political point-scoring," the source said.

HEADLINE: Swedish minister regrets possible US climate deal pullout

BODY:

Excerpt from report by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet website on 31 May

[Report by Ebba Thorneus and Martin Schori: "The World's Reactions to the United
States Possibly Leaving the Climate Accord. Climate Minister Isabella Lovin:
Deeply Regrettable."]

WASHINGTON. President Trump will take the United States out of the Paris
agreement on climate change, news website Axios reported on Wednesday [31 May].

For his own part, Trump says that he will give his answer during this week.

But reactions from the rest of the world have already started to come in and
several environmental organizations are reacting with dismay.

"It would be deeply regrettable if the United States decided to pull out of the
Paris accord," Climate Minister Isabella Lovin (Green Party) says to TT.

It is the website Axios that reports that US President Donald Trump, who
previously has called the climate threat "a hoax," is planning to abandon the
Paris agreement.

The information has been confirmed to American media by several sources.

Lovin: Climate Challenge Must Be Solved Jointly

Swedish Climate Minister Isabella Lovin (Green Party) says to TT that it would
be deeply regrettable if the United States decided to pull out of the Paris
agreement.

"It also goes against the leadership that we expect from the United States when
humanity is facing great challenges. The climate challenge must be solved
jointly. All countries have a responsibility to act and developed countries have
a special responsibility to reduce pollution and contribute to poorer countries'
work," she says in a statement.

HEADLINE: Danish minister deplores possible US climate deal pullout

BODY:

Text of report by Danish leading privately-owned independent newspaper Politiken
website, on 31 May

[Report by Danish news agency Ritzau Bureau: "Lilleholt: Bad Signal for the
Climate if the United States Backs Out"]

Reports that Donald Trump will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement are
causing concern in the Climate Ministry.

It is bad news if US President Donald Trump chooses to leave the Paris accord.

So says Energy, Utilities, and Climate Minister Lars Christian Lilleholt
(Liberal Party) after reports in several media outlets that the United States is
on its way out of the global climate agreement.

"If these rumours -- it must be said that they have been circulating for a while
-- are true, then it is a bad signal for the world's climate that I can only
deplore," he says.

However, he thinks that there is still hope for the future and points out that
it is not possible to pull out of the Paris agreement from one day to the next.

At the same time, it will in his view be difficult for Trump to put a complete
stop for the development towards a greener United States.

"Much of the work that must be done regarding the climate challenges in the
United States takes place at the state level," he says.

"So I am convinced that regardless of whether Trump pulls the United States out
of the climate agreement, a large number of states will still focus on green
conversion and renewable energy."

Nor is the minister worried about the survival of the climate agreement.

"There is so much support globally for the climate accord and the rest of the
world still stands behind it," he says.

"And it would obviously be best if the United States was still part of the
agreement, but they cannot stop it."

It has not yet been officially confirmed that the Americans will pull out of the
Paris accord, which was adopted in 2015.

It aims at keeping the Earth's warming under the level of 1.5-2 degrees,
maximum, compared to the preindustrial level.

Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday [31 May] that he would announce his decision
on the Paris agreement within the next few days.

For Lars Christian Lilleholt, it is now a matter of others taking the lead in
the fight against climate change.

"It is of course absolutely crucial that the EU shows leadership with regard to
keeping the level of ambition high and engaging in the climate discussion," he
says.

HEADLINE: Italy, Canada premiers confirm commitment to climate accord

BODY:

Text of report by Italian popular privately-owned financial newspaper Il Sole-24
Ore, on 31 May

[Report by Carlo Marroni: "Italy and Canada United on G-7 Challenges:
'Transatlantic Ties Cannot Make Us Forgo Fundamental Principles'"]

Italy and Canada are allied on all fronts, starting with climate and migrants.
This is a very important transatlantic alliance at this time, more so than in
the past, considering the disagreements with the new Administration led by
Donald Trump, who has de facto reneged on commitments taken by the United States
in the past and, in particular, is clashing with Germany. Yesterday, Prime
Ministers Paolo Gentiloni and Justin Trudeau met at Villa Madama [Italian
Foreign Ministry villa] where some of the top topics of the Taormina G-7 were
addressed again. In particular, it was confirmed that Italy agreed with the need
for European countries to be united over "global challenges," particularly at
this time of tension with the United States: "This in no way detracts from the
importance of transatlantic ties and relations with the United States, but this
cannot make us forgo fundamental principles such as those relating to climate
change, open society, and international free trade."

Washington has bought some time with regard to the decision on COP21 [Paris
climate agreement], "but I hope this position will be resolved in a positive
manner. In any case, it is clear with regard to Italy that our commitment for
the Paris accord continues, and it is an accord from which we do not wish to
backtrack." Trudeau too confirmed the following: "The climate accord is the only
solution to protect the environment and create 'green' jobs. We have initiated
the steps for the parliamentary ratification of the agreement and we will do all
we can do as international leaders" to extend the accord.

This therefore, is an international axis that the [Italian] government intends
to pursue, even though the domestic political prospects -- connected to the new
electoral law -- could lead to an early end of this parliament. "I confirm that
the government hopes for an agreement on the electoral law, but we are not
playing a leading role. I confirm that the government is in the fullness of its
powers and it has engagements it intends to respect," the Prime Minister
[Gentiloni] said in response to a question during the news conference. Be that
as it may, with regard to international relations, "Italy and Canada have
excellent ties based on ancient roots that are fostered by agreement and a
common vision between our two governments over topics such as international
security, the fight on terrorism, promoting a free market, and the need to keep
a positive attitude towards the global challenges posed by migration influxes,
environmental protection, and gender equality, as well as by all the sectors
that are weak in front of globalization."

Then he thanked the Canadian Prime Minister for the visit he made on Sunday [28
May] to Amatrice, the town most hit by the 2016 earthquake, accompanied by
Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano: "This has struck public opinion, and for
certain those images have revived a true solidarity race, not only among the
Italian-Canadian community, but in Canada in general."

Finally, there was the matter of trade: In the coming weeks, the EU-Canada trade
agreement will get underway: "CETA [Comprehensive Economic and trade Agreement]
will enter into force and this will be a very positive thing. It is a modern and
ambitious agreement that will reduce barriers between our countries, help
Canadian and European households, and create opportunities for entrepreneurs,"
Trudeau said. "Let us hope the ratification process is completed as soon as
possible," the Canadian Prime Minister added, "we cannot wait to complete it."
Gentiloni said he was certain that the law ratifying the treaty "will be aproned
by parliament swiftly. This is perhaps the most advanced treaty signed by the
EU."

HEADLINE: Kremlin says "no alternative" to Paris climate accord

BODY:

By BBC Monitoring

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that there
is no alternative to the Paris climate agreement but noted that the accord would
be difficult to implement without "key parties".

He was commenting on reports that US President Donald Trump may shortly announce
Washington's withdrawal from the agreement. Peskov's remarks were carried by the
state-owned news agency RIA Novosti on 1 June.

"You know that President Putin was in Paris and signed this convention (in 2016
- RIA Novosti). Russia attaches great significance to it. However, obviously,
the efficiency of the implementation of this convention is likely to become more
difficult without key parties, but there is currently no alternative," he was
quoted as saying.

He also said that Putin may discuss the issue with visiting Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi during their forthcoming talks.

"If our Indian partners raise this, then of course there will be an exchange of
opinion," Peskov said.

HEADLINE: German, French media see silver lining in Trump climate stand

BODY:

By BBC Monitoring

French and German media have described US President Donald Trump's stance on his
possible withdrawal from the hard-fought Paris climate accord as "cynical" and
"frustrating".

Yet, they found a silver lining, stressing that European countries could reach a
new level of cohesion and forge new alliances elsewhere.

No surprises

The German news magazine Der Spiegel said Trump "makes the world fidget, which
is cynical and frustrating, because actually the decision appears to have
already been made".

It noted that withdrawal from the climate deal would not be very surprising.

"He demonised the agreement in the election campaign, saying it is harmful to
the US economy. He appointed as environment minister a person who regards
climate change as a third-rate problem, and he loves to shock the international
public from time to time," the magazine wrote (tinyurl.com/y9sqyoy6).

The daily Bild, however, did not rule out a last-minute U-turn.

"It is possible that Trump's daughter Ivanka will still make him change his mind
at the very last moment, because she and her husband Jared Kushner are,
according to [US website] Politico, vehemently against an exit from the climate
agreement," the paper wrote (tinyurl.com/y89nnf2f).

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper was less enthusiastic, but warned
Trump against "cherishing illusions". "In questions of climate and trade policy,
Germany is currently forging new alliances. With China and India," it wrote
(tinyurl.com/ydz2kwhp).

Awakened Europe

In France, the media saw Trump facing a climate deal "dilemma" and stressed that
"a sleeping Europe" had a chance to "awaken".

According to the Monde daily, Trump will face two options if he decides to
withdraw from the climate agreement. Under the first option, the USA may have to
wait three years from the date the deal entered into force in November 2016, and
then give one year's notice.

"This means that the USA will be able to withdraw from the agreement in November
2020... [ellipsis as published] during the next presidential election in the
USA", it wrote.

The second option is to quit the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

"This is a tempting, yet risky option," the paper said, noting that while a
presidential decree should be enough to activate the process, it may later
require Congress's approval (tinyurl.com/y8btlu7l).

The Figaro daily said Trump's policies "widen the gap between America and
Europe", but "could awaken a sleeping Europe". The paper added, though, that the
awakening could be "brutal" (tinyurl.com/yap6olqf).

The Liberation newspaper appeared to find a silver lining too.

"The virulence of the US president against the backdrop of Brexit could
paradoxically prompt the Franco-German duo to accelerate to finally get the EU
out of its crisis," it said (tinyurl.com/yaahhynh).

HEADLINE: Italian minister says Trump's climate stance harmful to USA

BODY:

Text of report by Italian popular privately-owned financial newspaper Il Sole-24
Ore, on 30 May

[Interview with Gian Luca Galletti, Italian Environment Minister, by Jacopo
Giliberto; place and date not given: "'US Risks Losing Competitiveness Over
Climate'"]

"I remain convinced that the position of Donald Trump on the Paris climate
accord is penalizing for the United States itself," noted Gian Luca Galletti, a
Bologna man who will be 56 in July, and who has been Environment Minister since
February 2014.

[Giliberto] Minister Galletti, what will happen to climate policies if, after
Taormina, Trump rejects the December 2015 accord against climate change?

[Galletti] In Paris we got an irreversible mechanism under way, a mechanism
which, from the economic point of view, can give benefits to those who are able
to seize its opportunities. Firms which invest in the circular economy will be
more competitive, they will be stronger on the market because they will save
resources, they will use less energy, and they will produce less refuse. The
history of the last few years tells us that, in the years of the crisis, firms
which are committed to the environment have managed to grow and to generate
jobs. The environment is not just a major ethical and moral issue: It is also a
major economic issue, around which competitive differences in the fourth
industrial revolution will revolve. Well, the United States risks losing this
opportunity.

[Giliberto] In any event, will the Paris accord still remain firmly in place?

[Galletti] Yes, there is no turning back, regardless of the position of the
United States.

[Giliberto] The United States has always said: We will not accept agreements
which distort international competition, which create forms of environmental
dumping.

[Galletti] That is the case. The environmental competitiveness gap risks
becoming an even bigger problem unless we set ourselves common rules which
reduce the differences. Otherwise phenomena of environmental dumping are
generated. The Paris Accord binds us all by the same rules, and this is the only
global accord in which all the countries in the world promise to reduce C02
emissions. Certainly, every country will tend towards that objective at its own,
differing rate. But dumping worries me less if the Paris Accord is applied, and
it worries me more if there is no defence of the Paris Accord.

[Giliberto] Will it be one of the issues under discussion at the Environment G-7
summit, scheduled for 11 and 12 June in Bologna?

[Galletti] The Environment G-7 meeting will be an anomalous event, one way or
another, because it will be preceded for a week by around 80 preparatory
meetings at which we will hold wide-ranging discussions on the issue of the
environment, interpreting it in every possible way. You see, the environment is
not just the defence of natural resources. The environment is to be seen in line
with that vision of integral ecology which Pope Francis gave of it; the
continuous relationship between man and the environment in which man lives, and
understanding how the decay of the environment also reflects on human decay. We
will talk about inequality, and peace; representatives of the world's religions
will sign the Bologna Charter, and the Environment G-7 will have a broader scope
than the seven countries involved, and there will be, for example, the countries
of Africa, the ones which suffer, with emigration and famine, the disastrous
effects of climate change.

[Giliberto] So, will there also be discussion of climate change?

[Galletti] Certainly, at the Environment G-7 summit in Bologna we will launch a
discussion on the mechanisms to apply the Paris Accord. In other words, not just
the objectives of reducing CO2, but we will also talk about how countries can
help each other to achieve those goals, how to mobilize that 100 billion euros
which has been put up: We will talk about finance, banks, credit, environmental
fiscal issues, how to move subsidies from harmful actions to ecological
activities. And then we will talk about Italy, how to apply the SEN [National
Energy Strategy]. The National Energy Strategy intervenes on this issue. We have
set ourselves important environmental objectives, such as reducing at least 40
per cent of carbon dioxide emissions by the end of 2030, energy efficiency at 27
per cent, and renewable sources on 27 per cent. How can we achieve this?
Biomethane comes to mind, as do electrical and gas-powered cars, and sustainable
mobility. We will meet with all the mayors of metropolitan cities, and there
will be an accord between the four Regions in the Po valley basin to reduce thin
particles. As well as refuse which ends up in the sea, and the good practices
which Italy can teach, such as banning non-biodegradable plastic bags, and
Italy's bioplastic industry chain.

[Giliberto] Are protests by groups of demonstrators anticipated in Bologna?

[Galletti] I hope not; during the Environment G-7 summit, we will proclaim that
ecology is a collective asset which unites, it does not divide; in the
environment we all win together, the environment and man. In this city, which is
rich in civilization and humanity, we will talk about how to help Africa, how to
manage immigration involving environmental refugees, and the quality of air.
Everyone has to be able to contribute in this debate, especially those who are
discontent, but they must contribute in a civilised way.

HEADLINE: US pullout no threat to Paris climate pact - Russian MP

BODY:

Excerpt from report by privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax on 1 June

Moscow, 1 June: Moscow does not believe that the USA's withdrawal from the Paris
climate accord poses a threat this document, the head of the State Duma's
International Affairs Committee, Leonid Slutsky, has said.

"Back when information appeared about the possible US withdrawal from the Paris
climate accord, fears arose that this might make it harder to implement. But
let's hope that they will not be realised and the other main participants,
including Russia and China, will do everything possible to implement the
agreement whose main goal is to prevent an ecological catastrophe," Slutsky told
journalists on Thursday [1 June].

He noted that withdrawal from the Paris climate accord was a step towards
fulfilling Donald Trump's pre-election promises. "We are forced to accept this
decision, although it cannot, of course, fail to inspire a certain regret," he
said.

He drew attention to the fact that Russia has consistently maintained its
commitment to the Kyoto protocol and the Paris accord that replaced it. "We made
no small effort towards its development and signing," he said.

HEADLINE: US stocks back at record highs after better jobs data

BODY:

A broad-based push higher for stocks sent US indexes to records on Thursday
following yet more signs that the job market continues to improve.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index pierced the 2,420-point level for the first time
during the morning and kept going. It ended at 2,430.06, up 18.26 points, or
0.8%.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 135.53, or 0.6%, to 21,144.18, and the
Nasdaq composite rose 48.31, or 0.8%, to 6,246.83. All three indexes set record
highs.

Smaller stocks had even bigger gains, and the small-cap Russell 200 index jumped
25.85, or 1.9%, to 1,396.06, though it remains shy of its record.

Driving stocks higher was a report indicating that employers picked up their
hiring last month.

Payroll processor ADP said private businesses added 253,000 jobs in May, more
than economists expected. It is a reassurance, particularly when growth of the
overall economy has remained frustratingly tepid.

The US government's more comprehensive report on jobs arrives on Friday. It will
include hiring by all non-farm employers, and economists expect it to show
growth of 176,000 jobs in May.

The data gave yet more encouragement to investors, many of whom were already
looking to buy.

"The market's ahead of itself, but I'm not surprised that the market is ahead of
itself," said Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Investors.

Ms Duessel talks often around the country with financial advisers managing money
for clients, and many tell her they see any pullback in stock prices as a quick
opportunity to buy rather than as a source of concern.

That hunger to buy means the S&P 500 has gained within just months what Ms
Duessel thought may take a year or so to achieve, given continued economic
growth and few signs of a looming recession.

"What you have, it would appear, is an acceleration in earnings with a low
inflationary environment, which is Goldilocks," Ms Duessel said.

President Donald Trump's announcement late in the trading day that the US would
withdraw from the worldwide agreement on climate change had little effect on
markets.

Other reports on the US economy were mixed on Thursday.

Manufacturing growth picked up last month and was stronger than economists were
expecting, but construction spending unexpectedly weakened in April.

A separate report showed that the number of workers filing for unemployment
claims rose last week, which could be an indication that layoffs are on the
rise. The number remains low by historical standards.

The stock market's gains were widespread, and all 11 sectors that make up the
S&P 500 rose.

Healthcare and financial stocks led the way. Producers of raw materials and
companies that sell non-essentials to consumers were also particularly strong.

Discount retailer Dollar General jumped to one of the biggest gains in the S&P
500 after it reported stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts
expected. Its shares climbed 4.80 dollars, or 6.5%, to 78.19 dollars.

Deere rose 2.24 dollars, or 1.8%, to 124.70 dollars after it agreed to buy
Wirtgen Group, a German maker of road-construction equipment for about 4.6
billion euros, or 5.2 billion dollars, including debt.

On the other end was Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which fell to the largest loss
in the S&P 500 after it reported quarterly results that disappointed investors.
Its shares fell 1.29 dollars, or 6.9%, to 17.52 dollars.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.21%. A stronger job
market gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to raise interest rates, and its
next meeting on rate policy is in two weeks. The central bank has been gradually
pulling rates off their record low following the Great Recession, and it has
raised them twice since December.

The dollar rose to 111.33 Japanese yen from 110.57 yen late on Wednesday. The
euro fell to 1.1214 dollars from 1.1246 dollars, and the British pound dipped to
1.2876 dollars from 1.2892 dollars.

Benchmark US crude oil rose four cents to settle at 48.36 dollars per barrel.
Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 13 cents to settle at 50.63
dollars a barrel. Natural gas fell six cents to settle at 3.01 dollars per 1,000
cubic feet, heating oil slipped two cents to 1.50 dollars per gallon and
wholesale gasoline was close to flat at 1.60 dollars per gallon.

Gold fell 5.30 dollars to settle at 1,270.10 dollars per ounce, silver dropped
13 cents to 17.28 dollars per ounce and copper added a penny to 2.59 dollars per
pound.

In overseas markets, France's CAC-40 gained 0.7%, Germany's DAX advanced 0.4%
and London's FTSE 100 added 0.3%.

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6%, and South
Korea's Kospi shed 0.1%.

HEADLINE: Trump pulls US out of world climate change deal

BODY:

President Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the world's first comprehensive
deal on climate change.

Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, secured in
the French capital in December 2015, which commits countries to curbing rising
global temperatures.

But the president, who has previously labelled climate change a hoax by the
Chinese to hurt US manufacturing, also raised the possibility of negotiating to
re-enter the Paris accord or an entirely new deal on terms that were "fair" to
the US.

World leaders criticised the decision, with Prime Minister Theresa May telling
Mr Trump in a phone call of her "disappointment" at his decision to pull America
out of the Paris Agreement.

In a statement Downing Street said Mrs May had stressed to Mr Trump that the UK
remained committed to the deal which " provides the right global framework for
protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping
energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses".

The president was accused by climate experts of ignoring the science, and of
failing to see the opportunities of new clean technologies and of the jobs they
provide.

His decision, which would put the US alongside Nicaragua and Syria as the only
countries not signed up to the deal, was labelled by environmental campaigners
as an "act of vandalism" which put people's lives and livelihoods at risk.

At a press briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said t he US would end the
implementation of its voluntary commitments under the Paris Agreement to cut
greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels, and
its contribution to climate finance.

He said the deal allowed countries such as China and India to carry on polluting
while the US economy was harmed, saying it was "less about the climate and more
about other countries obtaining a financial advantage over the US".

The accord commits countries to holding global temperature rises to "well below"
2C above pre-industrial levels, which will require emissions to be cut to net
zero by the second half of the century.

Scientists have warned failure to curb dangerous climate change will lead to sea
level rises, more intense storms and flooding, more extreme droughts, water
shortages and heatwaves as well as massive loss of wildlife and reduction in
crop yields, potentially sparking conflict and mass migration.

Despite the decision by the US, the second biggest polluter after China, to pull
out of the deal, many analysts suggest the shift to a low carbon economy is now
unstoppable, with renewable prices tumbling and new clean technology being
developed and deployed.

And former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped preside over the
talks to secure the agreement, said: "The real economy both in the US and
internationally must and will continue its decarbonisation trend, pulled much
more strongly by market forces than held back by politics.

"States, cities, corporations, investors have been moving in this direction for
several years and the dropping prices of renewables versus the high cost of
health impacts from fossils guarantees the continuation of the transition," she
said.

The EU and China are set to affirm deeper commitment to climate action at a
summit on Friday.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump pulls out of Paris climate change accord;


 BODY:

Donald Trump has confirmed that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate
change accord.

The president made the announcement at a White House Rose Garden event.

Mr Trump said the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, secured in the
French capital in December 2015, which commits countries to curbing rising
global temperatures.

But he also raised the possibility of negotiating to re-enter the Paris accord
or an entirely new deal on terms that were "fair" to the US.

At the press briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: "In order to fulfil my
solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the US will withdraw from the
Paris climate accord."

The US would end the implementation of its voluntary commitments under the Paris
Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 compared with
2005 levels, and its contribution to climate finance, he said.

He said the deal allowed countries such as China and India to carry on polluting
while the US economy was harmed, saying it was "less about the climate and more
about other countries obtaining a financial advantage over the US".

But Mr Trump insisted he cared about the environment, and the US would be the
most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

His predecessor Barack Obama, who signed the Paris Agreement last year without
US Senate ratification, described the Trump administration as joining "a small
handful of nations that reject the future" by withdrawing from the pact.

Only Nicaragua and Syria have failed to sign up to the agreement and all the
major industrialised nations, except for Russia, have ratified it, with China
and the EU set to affirm their commitment to deeper action on Friday.

Countries that stay in the Paris deal will "reap the benefits" of jobs and
industries created and the US should be "at the front of the pack", Mr Obama
said.

Before the announcement, national leaders, the pope and the UN secretary general
were among those who had warned of the importance of climate action, and
environmental and aid campaigners reacted angrily to news of the US withdrawal.

The hard-won deal commits countries to holding global temperature rises to "well
below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, which will require emissions to be cut to
net zero by the second half of the century.

Scientists have warned failure to curb dangerous climate change will lead to sea
level rises, more intense storms and flooding, more extreme droughts, water
shortages and heatwaves as well as massive loss of wildlife and reduction in
crop yields, potentially sparking conflict and mass migration.

US corporate leaders including Apple, Google and Walmart have also appealed to
the businessman-turned-president to stay and even fossil fuel companies such as
Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal.

Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without Senate
ratification.

A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led European
Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to speak dismissively of Mr Trump on
Wednesday.

Mr Trump does not "comprehensively understand" the terms of the accord, though
European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him "in clear,
simple sentences" during summit meetings last week, Mr Juncker said in Berlin.

"It looks like that attempt failed. This notion, 'I am Trump, I am American,
America first and I am getting out', that is not going to happen."

HEADLINE: EU greenhouse gas emissions show first rise since 2010

BODY:

A new report shows that greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union rose in
2015 - the first increase since 2010.

The European Environment Agency said emissions grew by 0.5% compared with 2014,
mainly due to increases from transportation and a colder winter.

The report released on Thursday comes as the EU is trying to emphasise its
commitment to combating climate change.

Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to man-made climate change and most
countries around the world have pledged to reduce emissions under the Paris
climate accord.

The European Environment Agency noted that the EU has achieved a long-term
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2015 of 22.1%, despite
economic growth of 50%.

HEADLINE: Chinese premier leads calls to keep up fight against global warming

BODY:

China has led international calls to keep up the fight against global warming,
hours before US president Donald Trump announces whether he will pull out of the
Paris climate accord.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said in Berlin that fighting global warming is a
"global consensus" and an "international responsibility".

Without mentioning the US specifically, Mr Li said that "China in recent years
has stayed true to its commitment", and pointed out that it was one of the first
countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has in the past even been dubbed the
"climate chancellor" for her efforts to fight global warming, welcomed Mr Li's
remarks at their joint press conference.

Other European leaders issued more explicit appeals to the US government not to
abandon international measures against climate change.

European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted: "Please don't change the
(political) climate for the worse."

Mr Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday afternoon US time (8pm
BST).

Abandoning the pact would isolate the US from a raft of international allies who
spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution
by reducing carbon emissions.

While travelling abroad last week, Mr Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in
the deal by European leaders as well as Pope Francis.

Withdrawing would leave the US as one of just three countries outside the
agreement, with the other two being Syria and Nicaragua.

Russia joined the chorus speaking out in favour of the climate accord.

A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia "thinks highly" of the
accords and sees no alternative to it.

Dmitry Peskov added that its implementation will not be as effective "without
the key signatories".

During a trip to Europe this week, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi expressed
India's commitment to fighting climate change and said it would be a "crime" to
spoil the environment for future generations.

Martin Schulz, a former European Parliament president who is hoping to unseat
Mrs Merkel in Germany's upcoming general election, said he hoped Mr Trump would
think better of withdrawing from the accord.

If the US does leave, he said, the European Union should seek ways to balance
out the economic advantage that US companies might have from the absence of
climate regulations.

"Those who want to export their goods and services to our market also have to
accept our standards," he added.

Scientists say the planet is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming
sooner if the US retreats from its pledge, because America contributes so much
to rising temperatures.

Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to three billion additional
tonnes of carbon dioxide a year - enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise sea
levels and trigger more extreme weather.

HEADLINE: Trump to announce decision on Paris climate deal

BODY:

Donald Trump will announce his decision on whether to pull the United States out
of the Paris climate accord during a White House Rose Garden event today.

The US president promoted his announcement on Twitter after a day in which
American allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of
a US withdrawal.

Mr Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a
lot of people both ways".

The White House signalled that Mr Trump was likely to decide on exiting the
global pact - fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges - though top
aides were divided.

The final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: aides were still deliberating
on "caveats in the language", one official said.

Everyone cautioned that no decision was final until Mr Trump announced it.

The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends
to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing
agendas, until the last minute.

Abandoning the pact would isolate the US from a raft of international allies who
spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution
by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations.

While travelling abroad last week, Mr Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in
the deal by European leaders and the Vatican.

Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the
world's industrialised economies.

American corporate leaders including Apple, Google and Walmart have also
appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay and even fossil fuel
companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide
by the deal.

Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without Senate
ratification.

A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led European
Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to speak dismissively of Mr Trump on
Wednesday.

Mr Trump does not "comprehensively understand" the terms of the accord, though
European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him "in clear,
simple sentences" during summit meetings last week, Mr Juncker said in Berlin.

"It looks like that attempt failed. This notion, 'I am Trump, I am American,
America first and I am getting out', that is not going to happen."

Some of Mr Trump's aides have been searching for a middle ground, perhaps by
renegotiating the terms of the agreement, in an effort to thread the needle
between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a US
exit would land a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to
worldwide US leadership.

Secretary of state Rex Tillerson has favoured remaining in the agreement and
chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection
Agency administrator Scott Pruitt.

Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn has discussed the possibility of
changing the US carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal
completely.

Senior adviser Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law, generally thinks the deal
is bad but would still like to see if emissions targets can be changed.

Mr Trump's influential daughter Ivanka's preference is to stay, but she has made
it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all
sides, a senior administration official said.

The emissions goals are voluntary, with no real consequences for countries that
fail to meet them.

That means the US could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or
stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

America has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26-28% of 2005 levels -
about 1.6 billion tons.

Mr Trump's Democratic presidential rival and former US first lady Hillary
Clinton called Mr Trump's stance "totally incomprehensible".

Speaking at a conference near Los Angeles, she said to back out of the agreement
would be "throwing out the economic opportunities that being part of the Paris
agreement provide for the United States".

HEADLINE: Latest: Barack Obama criticises 'absence of American leadership' in
wake of US withdrawing from Paris Agreement

BODY:

<strong>Update 9.20pm:</strong> Former US President Barack Obama has expressed
his disappointment at Donald Trump's decision to remove the US from the Paris
Agreement and join "a small handful of nations that reject the future", saying
it shows an "absence of American leadership".

"A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever
global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world
we leave to our children," he said.

"It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that
achievement possible. It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of
other nations to set their sights higher as well.

"And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America's private
innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar
industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in
recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our
history.

"Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the
nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the
floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech,
low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.

"The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap
the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of
America should be at the front of the pack.

"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration
joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our
states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way,
and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."

<strong>Update 9pm:</strong> News that the United States intends to withdraw
from the Paris Agreement has been met with concern and extreme disappointment by
the Irish politicians.

Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Denis Naughten
expressed his concern following the announcement.

"I am extremely disappointed and concerned that the United States has decided to
withdraw from the Paris Agreement," said Mr Denis Naughten T.D., Minister for
Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

"This is a major setback for the international community and it is essential
that the decision of the United States does not weaken global resolve."

"Ireland remains committed to continuing to work with its EU partners under the
UN Framework to make the Paris Agreement a success and to ensure that all of the
EU's international partners stay committed to the Agreement.

"Upon their withdrawal the US will join Nicaragua and Syria as the only
countries outside the Paris Agreement."

Labour spokesperson on Climate Change, Sean Sherlock TD, said he is "dismayed"
by Trump's decision to withdraw.

"I am really dismayed by President Trump's announcement that the US will no
longer honour its Paris Climate Accord commitments," he said.

"While the US decision will not completely derail the deal, I am concerned that
it will weaken the impact, and the move sends a worrying message that one of the
major global powerhouses, the United States, has decided to withdraw from the
deal in its current form.

"Ireland now must up the ante with its own commitment to tackling the impact of
climate change and resolve to increase efforts in this regard."

Sinn Féin MEP, Lynn Boylan added her concerns, saying the decision highlights
the US President's "complete ignorance to science, facts and what is now
considered a self-evident truth"

"It is deeply disturbing, yet hardly surprising, that Donald Trump has decided
to backtrack on decades of progress made on climate change. The Paris Accord
brought 195 countries together to work collectively to reduce the effects of
climate change and it marks one of the greatest examples of international
co-operation in human history.

"However, Trump's unilateral action, in an attempt to derail this crucial
agreement, displays his complete ignorance to science, facts and what is now
considered a self-evident truth.

"The USA is the second largest greenhouse gas polluter in the world. The failure
to recognise and address this by the new US administration constitutes a severe
weakening of its credibility on the world stage, with ramifications beyond
climate change."

<strong>Update 20.30:</strong> President Donald Trump has confirmed that the
United States is withdrawing from the Paris Accord, citing economic reasons.

Trump said the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, secured in the French
capital in December 2015, which commits countries to curbing rising global
temperatures.

But he also raised the possibility of negotiating to re-enter the Paris accord
or an entirely new deal on terms that were "fair" to the US.

"In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the
United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord," Trump said.

"We're getting out, but we will start to negotiate and see if we can negotiate a
deal that's fair.

"As of today the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding
Paris Accord."

He claimed the agreement was more about other countries "gaining a financial
advantage over the United States" than about climate change.

"Withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the
climate," he said.

He added that America is the "cleanest and most environmentally friendly country
on Earth."

"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," he said.

<strong>Earlier:</strong> Reports are emerging that the US is to officially
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Reuters news agency is reporting that a White House document confirms the news.

The reports indicate that Trump will say the decision to withdraw 'is keeping
his campaign promise to put American workers first' and that that under the
Paris agreement, China would continue to increase its emissions until 2030.

The US's withdrawal from the Paris agreement to follow U.N. procedures will take
up to four years.

Trump is expected to issue a statement at 8pm.

More to follow.

HEADLINE: EU greenhouse gas emissions show first rise since 2010

BODY:

A new report shows that greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union rose in
2015 - the first increase since 2010.

The European Environment Agency said emissions grew by 0.5% compared with 2014,
mainly due to increases from transportation and a colder winter.

The report released on Thursday comes as the EU is trying to emphasise its
commitment to combating climate change.

Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to man-made climate change and most
countries around the world have pledged to reduce emissions under the Paris
climate accord.

The European Environment Agency noted that the EU has achieved a long-term
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2015 of 22.1%, despite
economic growth of 50%.

Matt Furey-King, Green Party

Age: 35

Where do you live? Warmley

How long have you lived there? 3 months (just moved back)

Where did you live previously? Aberdeen. Have lived in Hong Kong, Germany,
Chester, Devizes. Grew up in Warmley.

What do you do for a living? Aircraft Engineer

Political career: Founded sports association UK Airsoft Players Union, President
of European sports federation European Airsoft Association for 6 years.
Organiser with the campaign group Firearms UK. Spent allot of time lobbying in
Westminster and Brussels for airsoft players rights. Active trade union member.

Other interests? Hiking, 4x4 driving, travel, electronic and mechanical
tinkering, tabletop wargames, airsoft milsim.

Why do you want to be elected? Because there's not enough honest and plain
speaking people in the house of commons. I want to help steer the country back
on track. I'm sick of politicians being parachuted into safe seats and then just
using the opportunity to line their own pockets.

Why do you think you would be a success? I'm not a career politician, I'm just a
local engineer. Most people in Westminster don't seem to understand what's going
on in real people's lives. I've experienced the real world and have seen the
effects of bad policy first hand. I'm an ex soldier, served in Iraq and
Afghanistan, Parliament needs to hear the voice of the people who they have been
putting in tragic, unwinnable wars.

What would your main aims be? Get climate change at the top of the agenda.
Resecure citizens' online privacy. Defend the NHS. Push for foreign policy that
makes the UK a force for good, and keeps us safe. Fix broken electoral system.
Affordable nationalised public transport. Demand referendum on terms of Brexit -
if in two years they have negotiated a rubbish deal which is bad for our
country, we should be asked if we still want to leave.

What would you like to say to voters? There's enough resources for us all to be
happy, to live good lives, and we can do that without destroying the planet.
That's what's at stake here - the way we are going, we're going to leave our
children a planet which is in unheard-of turmoil, that will spiral further and
further into apocalypse. It's that serious.

Every government for the last 20 years has stolen our rights, stopped us from
living our lives the way we want, has invaded our privacy through legal and
illegal means, has imposed themselves upon us.

The bent economic and political system we have is just channeling more wealth to
a few people,  while the rest of us are fighting to just get by. We are one of
the world's richest countries but some of us can't afford to eat! All the while
they tell you it's the fault of immigrants or the EU, or some other convenient
bogeyman. The government throws billions of pounds at wars and nuclear weapons,
and tells you they cant find money to sustain our schools, police, firefighters
and our NHS. They tell you that this is the way it has to be, but that's a
damned lie.

So let's change things. The power rests with you. I know the Green Party is our
best chance to save our society, planet and country.

You can give us the power to do that by putting me, a Green MP, in parliament,
where I will fight for you every single day.

 Members of the Green Party are urging voters with environmental concerns to
back Labour's Kerry McCarthy for MP in Bristol East.   The race in the
constituency is  too close to call, with the Conservatives throwing everything
at it in recent weeks in an attempt to reverse Labour's 4,000 majority.

The Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary have all visited
Bristol East during the campaign to support the local Tory candidate Theo
Clarke.  With the threat of the seat turning blue, the Greens for Kerry movement
has been set up by Green Party members.

Ms McCarthy,inset, the Labour candidate and MP for the area for the last 12
years, is the former shadow environment secretary, as well as being a vegan,
anti-fox hunting and pro-renewable energy.  Laura, the Green member behind the
campaign, said Ms McCarthy was the only candidate standing on an environmental
platform who could win in Bristol East. The Green Party secured 3,800 votes at
the 2015 general election, coming fourth overall.   UKIP meanwhile, which
secured 7,000 votes to come third two years ago, has opted not to stand in
Bristol East and called on supporters to back the pro-Brexit Tory candidate as
"the lesser of two evils".

Laura, who asked not to have her surname published for professional reasons,
said: "A group of us felt  it could be a really tight race to keep Kerry as our
local MP for Bristol East.  She has got a stalwart environmental record, both in
Bristol and in Parliament. So, given the smaller parties don't stand a chance of
winning, if you want to make progress on environmental protections and tackling
climate change, then it is up to us to  campaign and let people know about Kerry
and her track record."

The environmental charity worker said the Conservative manifesto was "silent" on
climate change and gave "the go-ahead to fracking", while Labour's  seemed more
forthcoming.  Labour would ban fracking, invest in low carbon energy and place a
ban on bee-killing pesticides, according to their manifesto.  Ms McCarthy
welcomed the support she was receiving from Green members.

"It's great to have Green party supporters out campaigning with me during this
election, as well as many former Green voters now telling me they're voting
Labour," said Ms McCarthy.

Tory candidate Ms Clark said tactical voting would "only increase the chance" of
Britain being led by "a weak, shambolic Jeremy Corbyn".  "I don't think any
party should take voters for granted," said the former Russian-arts blogger.
"Residents in Bristol East will rightly make up their own minds on who they will
choose to elect as their MP."

HEADLINE: Trump to announce decision on global climate deal today

BYLINE: Business World

BODY:

President Donald Trump on Thursday will announce his decision on whether to keep
the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, as a source close to
the matter said he was preparing to pull out of the Paris accord.

Trump said in a Twitter post on Wednesday night that he would make the
announcement at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Thursday in the White House Rose
Garden, ending his tweet with "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

A U.S. withdrawal would deepen a rift with U.S. allies and put the United States
in the same league as Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants
in the landmark 195-nation accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.

Scientists have said a U.S. withdrawal from the deal could speed up the effects
of global climate change, leading to heat waves, floods, droughts, and more
frequent violent storms.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump blasted the accord, saying it would
cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars with no tangible benefit.

The Republican vowed at the time to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100 days of
becoming president on Jan. 20, part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal
industries.

Since taking office, however, he has come under pressure from advisers, close
allies, corporate CEOs, Democrats and some fellow Republicans to keep the United
States in the accord - causing him to rethink and delay his decision.

Some executives from coal companies have weighed in, arguing the U.S. should
stay in with reduced emissions cuts targets, with an eye toward ensuring that
Washington keeps some influence over the future of the global energy mix.

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was favoring an exit,
however, and was working out terms of the planned withdrawal with U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally
and climate change doubter.

The pact was the first legally-binding global deal to fight climate change.
Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global
emissions of "greenhouse" gases. These include carbon dioxide generated from
burning of fossil fuels that scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level
rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.

The United States, under former President Barack Obama, had committed to reduce
its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Are diesels still worth buying?;
The tables have turned on diesel-engined cars. We look at what's happening and
whether you should still buy one

BODY:

THERE APPEARS TO have been a massive U-turn in the official opinion on diesel
cars. They've gone from being the most favoured - and financially incentivised -
models to some of those hit hardest by punitive levels of taxation. So should
you shun diesel cars, or is it still okay to buy one? Why has the Government
turned against diesels? Diesel-engined cars were promoted by successive UK
governments for more than a decade because they have, on average, 20% lower CO2
emissions and 20% better official fuel economy than their petrol counterparts.
These are important factors in helping to tackle climate change. Drivers
appreciated the lower road tax (VED) and company car tax that were applicable to
diesels and their popularity grew. Today, there are more than 10 million diesel
cars on our roads and they account for almost half of the new cars registered
each year.

However, the Government now needs to address the levels of pollution in our
cities, because it is being sued by the European Commission for repeatedly
breaching air pollution limits.

The nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by diesel engines are one cause of air
pollution. So, as well as announcing the introduction of extra charges for the
oldest, highest-polluting diesels if they're driven in urban areas at peak
times, the Government has changed the road tax banding system for new cars so
that after the first year, owners of petrol and diesel cars will pay the same
rate.

Another reason for the change in road tax is that around a quarter of the new
cars being registered have emissions of 99g/km or less, so they qualified for
free road tax under the previous system. While this demonstrates the
improvements car makers have made in reducing CO2 emissions in cars with all
types of engines, it also means the Government has been raising far less in road
tax.

How polluting are diesel cars? Although diesel-engined cars emit more
particulates than petrol ones, their CO2 emissions are generally lower. It's
also important to note that older diesels have far higher particulate and CO2
emissions than newer ones and that the EU has been tightening up on emissions
since 1992.

The first Europe-wide emissions standards, applicable to all new cars registered
from January 1993, set an upper limit of 2.72g/km of carbon monoxide (CO) and
0.97g/km of NOx for diesel engines.

Significant improvements were made with the Euro 5 standard that applies to cars
registered after January 2011. In order to comply with the limit of 0.18g/km of
NOx, diesel-engined cars had to be fitted with diesel particulate filters (DPFs)
that capture 99% of all particulate matter before it escapes out of the exhaust.

The latest diesel-engined cars (those sold from September 2015 onwards) comply
with Euro 6 regulations and are the cleanest in history. As well as being fitted
with DPFs, they have systems that convert most of the NOx from the engine to
largely harmless nitrogen and water; for diesel engines, their NOx emissions
cannot exceed 0.08g/km.

How has road tax changed? Until recently, cars with CO2 emissions of 99g/km or
less qualified for free road tax. However, from 1 April this year, only
zeroemissions cars costing less than £40,000, such as pure electric models,
qualify. The first-year rate is still dependent on CO2 emissions and ranges from
£10 for cars with a CO2 output of 1-50g/km to £2000 for those with more than
255g/km. After that, a flat rate of £140 per year is payable on cars costing
less than £40,000.

Hybrid vehicles qualify for a £10 reduction in annual fees, but buyers of all
vehicles costing more than £40,000 (including fully electric ones) have to pay
an additional annual fee of £310 in years two to six. This change only applies
to new cars registered on or after 1 April; it doesn't affect cars registered
before that date. So, if you buy a second-hand diesel car with 99g/km of CO2
emissions, it will still qualify for free road tax.

What other charges do diesel car owners face? In London, drivers of diesel and
petrol cars first registered before 2006 that do not meet Euro 4 NOx standards
will have to pay the Toxicity or T-Charge from 23 October 2017. It is an
additional fee of £10 that will be payable for vehicles entering the current
Congestion Charge zone 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

In April 2019, a new Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) will be created in the
capital to replace the T-Charge. Once it's in operation, drivers of diesel
vehicles that don't meet Euro 6 emissions standards and petrol vehicles that
don't comply with Euro 4 standards will have to pay an extra £12.50 to drive
through certain parts of the city. It will affect diesel cars registered before
September 2015 and petrols registered before 2006.

It's expected that other cities around the UK will follow London's lead with the
scheme.

Is anything being done to help owners of diesel cars to cope with the extra
costs? Although there will be no assistance with the cost of road tax on new
diesel cars, the Government has said it will aim to help owners of diesels
living inside the ULEZ and other areas where low-emissions zones are introduced.

There are no official details yet about what form that assistance might take,
but it is believed that a diesel scrappage scheme will be introduced to
encourage owners to trade in higher-emissions diesels for cleaner models.

What about other European cities? There are more than 200 low-emissions zones in
cities throughout Europe, so if you're thinking of driving abroad, check such
schemes along your planned route and at the destination.

Paris is among the most recent to introduce a scheme to combat air pollution.
Its Air Quality Certificate scheme bans cars first registered before 1997 from
entering the city between 8am and 8pm on weekdays. It also bans motorcycles
first registered before 2000 and buses and HGVs built before 2001.

Newer vehicles are rated on their emissions and will qualify for one of six
different coloured windscreen stickers that will allow access to the city inside
the Périphérique ring road.

The cost of a sticker is (EURO)3.70 (£3.20) plus postage and they can be
requested via the Air Quality Certification Service
(www.certificat-air.gouv.fr).

HEADLINE: Trump to announce decision on Paris climate agreement soon

BODY:

WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the world would know
his decision on the Paris climate agreement over the next few days.

"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

Citing senior US officials familiar with Trump's plan, several US mainstream
media reported Wednesday morning that Trump is expected to withdraw from the
Paris Accord adopted by 196 nations in 2015.

However, CNN quoted US officials speaking on condition of anonymity as saying
that Trump's position on the Paris Accord could still change until he makes his
decision public.

The Trump administration was initially planning to make a final decision on the
Paris Accord early this month. However, the decision was delayed till the G7
meeting in Sicily, Italy.

However, Trump left the G7 summit without agreeing to endorse the Paris Accord
to cut global carbon emissions, raising eyebrows among leaders of US key allies
in the group.

HEADLINE: California, China allies on climate: Gov Brown

BYLINE: Lia Zhu and Chang Jun in San Francisco

BODY:

California and China need to work more closely and encourage each other to take
more aggressive steps to de-carbonize, said California Governor Jerry Brown on
Wednesday ahead of his upcoming trip to China.

"I want people in China to know that the people in America are enthusiastically
working to de-carbonize," Brown told China Daily in his State Capitol office.

The weeklong trip starting Friday will take him to Beijing, Chengdu and Nanjing,
where he is scheduled to meet with national and regional officials and promote
climate change cooperation.

The trip comes four years after his last China trip - a trade mission in 2013.

The goal of this trip is to strengthen the working relations between China and
California on zero-emission vehicles, regulatory strategies, reducing carbon
pollution and research development, particularly at the university level, said
Brown.

In Beijing, he will attend the Clean Energy Ministerial, an annual meeting of
national energy ministers and other high-level delegates, and meet with members
of Under2 Clean Energy Forum, a coalition dedicated to fighting climate change.

After Beijing, the governor will travel to Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province,
and Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province, the first Chinese provinces joining
the Under2 Coalition, which includes cities, states and provinces who have
signed an international agreement promoted by Brown to reduce emissions at rates
faster than those called for under the Paris agreement.

"I'd like to see how obstacles are overcome. I want to see what is being done in
these two places," said Brown. "I'd like to take high-speed rail. I like
high-speed rail."

California is working with Chinese sub-national jurisdictions to achieve
standardization of some environmental rules and promote joint ventures on clean
energy investments, according to the governor.

He said technicians in both countries should work together to standardize the
rules for electric cars, new energy and all the different consumer goods, so
that it's more efficient in producing the lower-carbon future that the world
needs.

"The challenge of climate change is greater than what the world is now doing. We
are not doing enough, China is not doing enough, California is not doing enough,
and the world is not doing enough," said Brown.

He said the world needs to face the fact that greenhouse gases are still rising.
"We have to make the turn and making the turn is easier if many countries and
states work together," he said.

"Mr. Trump has a different view, I don't think that view will last for too
long," he said. "In the meanwhile, states and cities are ready to work with
China."

HEADLINE: China-EU cooperation can counter global uncertainty

BODY:

With the world facing multiple uncertainties and new challenges, closer and
stronger ties between China and European countries cater not only to their
mutual interests but also benefit the world at large.

Premier Li Keqiang's ongoing visit to Germany and Belgium, though planned
earlier, came just days after US President Donald Trump's first
upsetting-of-the-apple-cart visit to Europe, which prompted German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to say that Europe can no longer fully rely on others.

In contrast, during their meeting in Berlin on Wednesday, Li and Merkel time and
again emphasized the importance of bilateral ties and vowed to accelerate the
synergy of their countries' respective economic strategies.

Such determination to continue to nourish the tree of friendship and enrich and
expand pragmatic, reciprocal cooperation will not only contribute to their
respective development needs but also help to shore up global confidence that it
is not just every country for itself, as Trump keeps implying.

Thanks to their mutual efforts in deepening political trust and expanding
all-round cooperation, Sino-German ties have become the most profound and the
most reliable nation-to-nation ties among China's relations with European
countries.

And as the world's two most predictable and most stable forces, China and
Germany are acting as confidence boosters and rallying others to the causes of
global economic development and stability.

Sharing broad common interests and similar stances on important regional and
international issues, the two are increasingly looked to for leadership in
shoring up the open economy, free trade and investment.

And in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world, it is a natural
choice for China and the EU to work together to deepen mutual trust, fend off
protectionism and unlock the development potential of their relations.

Li is scheduled to meet EU leaders in Brussels on Friday, and the two sides are
expected to discuss ways to maintain the good momentum that has been achieved in
bilateral cooperation in traditional economic and trade fields while also
vigorously promoting greater cooperation in new areas such as infrastructure,
finance and the digital economy.

And as the United States is poised to withdraw from the Paris Accord on climate
change, which will send the message that it's putting its own interests first
and the devil take the hindmost, Li and the EU leaders are expected to issue a
joint declaration on combating climate change on Friday, consolidating the
consensus of the rest of the international community that common interests take
precedence and outweigh any differences.

HEADLINE: China, EU to focus on trade, investment and climate as Trump ponders

BYLINE: Fu Jing in Brussels

BODY:

The European Union said today that China and the 28-member bloc will focus on
trade and investment and climate change, as Presidenrt Donald Trump considers
withdrawal from the Paris Agreement during Friday's Sino-EU summit.

The EU made the announcement ahead of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's arrival in
Brussels on Thursday afternoon after his German tour.

It said that Li will be holding informal meeting with European Council President
Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker late on
Thursday before their summit on Friday morning.

After the summit, Li will meet Belgian leaders before wrapping his up his
European tour, which started on Wednesday.

While the summit will be focusing on investment and trade, the EU said in a
background document: "The second agenda item will focus on global, international
and regional issues. This will include climate change and clean energy, in
particular in relation to the implementation of the Paris Agreement."

The media has reported that China and the EU will be making joint declaration on
climate change once Trump has announced his decision, expected later today.

The EU said the Sino-EU summit will be the first one since the adoption of the
new EU strategy on China in July 2016, which sets out how both sides can take
advantage of their cooperation to promote long-term benefits for EU and Chinese
citizens.

"The first item on the formal agenda is EU-China bilateral relations, with a
focus on trade and investment, including the negotiations towards a
Comprehensive Investment Agreement," the EU said in the document.

The EU said that connectivity will also be on the agenda, as leaders are
expected to prioritize progress on the EU-China connectivity platform. The aim
is to coordinate on transport policies and to identify projects of common
interest between Europe and China, based on transparency and a level playing
field.

FINANCIAL TIMES BRAZIL'S CENTRAL BANK CUTS KEY RATE TO 10.25PC Brazil's central
bank yesterday slashed the key interest rate by one percentage point to 10.25
per cent, continuing its pace of cuts amid a political crisis that has sown
uncertainty just as Latin America's largest economy was seen as crawling back
from its worst recession ever. The decision of the monetary policy committee,
Copom, was unanimous, after inflation fell to a near 10-year low below the
official 4.5 per cent target.

PALO ALTO NETWORKS SOARS ON EARNINGS Palo Alto Networks shares jumped more than
11 per cent in after-hours trading last night after the US cybersecurity
company's earnings came in ahead of expectations amid strong customer sign-ups.
Revenue rose 25 per cent in the third quarter to end-April.

THE TIMES LAMPRELL 'TRANSFORMED' BY SAUDI ARABIA DEAL A London-listed oil
services company has struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's giant national oil
company to help to build and operate the biggest maritime yard in the region.
Lamprell is one of four partners in a "transformational" $5.2bn (£4bn) joint
venture that opens up a potentially lucrative entry into the industry's most
important market.

ACADEMICS CHALLENGE OXFORD OVER RETIREMENT Ageing academics at the University of
Oxford are challenging rules that force them to retire at 67, arguing that the
age cap makes the institution uncompetitive.

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH MURDOCH BROTHERS HOLD TALKS WITH OFCOM The Murdoch brothers
have held secret talks with Ofcom in a bid to persuade the regulator to wave
through 21st Century Fox's planned £11.7bn takeover of Sky. It is understood
that Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, has met James and Lachlan Murdoch
in London in the last week to discuss the proposed deal.

PETROFAC CUT TO JUNK RATING BY MOODY'S Petrofac has been cut to junk status by

ENVIRONMENT campaigner Chris Southall has criticised Ukip after the party stated
there was "no scientific basis" for the Climate Change Act.

Mr Southall, who is standing for the Green Party in the upcoming General
Election, said the Ukip was wrong over global warming and that rising sea levels
are threatening coastal areas such as Jaywick.

Ukip's manifesto said the party would repeal the Climate Change Act, which it
claims has no basis in science, and that our major global competitors benefit
from using low-cost fossil fuels.

It also said the party would withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement
to enhance our industrial competitiveness.

Mr Southall said green taxes, which are opposed by Ukip, have helped some of the
poorest residents in the district.

"Even a quick glance at the energy section of the Ukip manifesto shows the lack
of a scientific foundation for their policies," he said.

"The statements made about green tax additions to electricity bills are also
wildly wrong.

"The majority of this part of people's electricity bill is to help poorer
families and pensioners to reduce their energy consumption and so lower their
electricity costs.

"Ukip complains about pensioners being unable to heat their homes while trashing
the very measures designed to help them. The insulation fitted free to some of
the homes in Jaywick was one example of the use of this money.

"The assertion that climate change acts has no 'basis in science' flies in the
face of the urgent pleas of thousands of scientists to take climate change
seriously.

"As the Arctic ice melts and the sea level rises and threatens to flood eastern
coastal regions, like Jaywick again, Ukip wants to turn back the clock to the
days of polluting coal burning power stations, accelerating the rise of climate
change and air pollution."

Mr Southall said his party takes climate change very seriously and will work
with others across the world to reduce the burning of fossil fuels before the
changes become irreversible.

Ukip candidate Paul Oakley had not responded at the time of going to press.

Also standing for the Clacton seat at the election are David Grace (Lib Dems),
Nick Martin (Ind), Tasha Osben (Lab), Caroline Shearer (Ind), Chris Southall
(Green), Robin Tilbrook (English Democrats) and Giles Watling (Con).

HEADLINE: 'Demented orange clown' Donald Trump announces US withdrawal from
Paris climate deal and Twitter is not happy;
The move drew widespread international criticism with campaigners in the UK
labelling it an 'act of vandalism'.

BYLINE: By Record Reporter

BODY:

President Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the world's first comprehensive
deal on climate change, he has announced.

Trump said the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, secured in the French
capital in December 2015, which commits countries to curbing rising global
temperatures.

But he also raised the possibility of negotiating to re-enter the Paris accord
or an entirely new deal on terms that were "fair" to the US.

The move drew widespread international criticism, with campaigners in the UK
labelling it an "act of vandalism".

The mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, where a landmark global climate agreement was
agreed in December 2015, said the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to
withdraw from the deal was "a mistake that would have dramatic consequences."

"That incredible diplomatic achievement could not have been secured without the
decisive role of the United States of America. That is why President Trump is
committing a mistake with dramatic and fatal consequences," she said.

Punters on Twitter were quick to express their fury at Trump's controversial
decision, with one person calling him a "demented orange clown."

HEADLINE: Thick black smoke seen above Vatican as eyewitness describe 'loud
boom';
Footage captured by a witness living nearby shows huge plumes of smoke.

BYLINE: By Danya Bazaraa

BODY:

Plumes of black smoke have been filling the air above the Vatican .

It is not clear exactly what the cause of the smoke is but lots of photos and
videos have been shared on social media.

One eyewitness living nearby who tweeted images of the scene, said it seemed to
be coming from a neighbourhood just behind Vatican City.

'I'd do it again' Hero Scot tells of moment he tackled man threatening to blow

Mountain Butorac said he saw the smoke from his roof, "then a few minutes later
there was a loud boom and more smoke".

"I've heard lots of sirens," he added. "The smoke was drifting high over my
apartment."

He spotted the smoke just after 5pm local time and emergency services are
currently on the scene.

Mr Butorac said he can see smoke settling over Piazza del Popolo, which he
'assumes is from the same fire'.

He added: "I can definitely smell it now. The smell of the smoke is strong now
on Borgo Pio."

daughter died in Manchester terror attack

Local reports claim the fire is in the Primavalle district of Rome, in the
Battistini-Cornelia area, and say the flames have "shrouded a building".

Corriere TV has said the thick black smoke is sweeping the entire area and
heading towards the Pineto Park.

An unconfirmed report claims the fire is "burning in a car yard" a couple of
kilometres away from the Vatican.

The incident comes after the Vatican criticised the US over climate change
issues earlier today.

The Vatican, which under Pope Francis' insistence has strongly backed the Paris
climate change deal, would see a US exit as a 'slap in the face' and a "disaster
for everyone," a senior official said last month.

At a meeting in May, the pope gave U.S. President Donald Trump a signed copy of
his 2015 encyclical letter that called for protecting the environment from the
effects of climate change and backed scientific evidence that it is caused by
human activity.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin urged Trump in a separate
meeting not to quit the Paris accord.

HEADLINE: FBI name Nigel Farage as 'person of interest' in investigation of
Trump links to Russia;
The former Ukip leader became a close ally of Trump during the 2016 presidential
Election campaign.

BYLINE: By Mikey Smith

BODY:

Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been named by the FBI as a "person of
interest" in their investigation into Donald Trump's alleged links with Russia.

The Brexiteer is being scrutinised by investigators, in part, because of a
meeting held between him and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

Farage became a close ally of Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential
Election campaign.

And he appeared with Trump at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi in August.

According to the Guardian, Farage has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not
a suspect or the target of the investigation.

Fired FBI chief set to confirm that Donald Trump pressured him to axe inquiry
into Russia ties

But investigators are probing Farage's closeness to other people who are targets
in the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the Presidential
race.

Farage was confronted with questions about links to Russia and his meeting with
Assange last month, in an interview with German newspaper Zelt.

At first he said he'd made the trip to the Wikileaks founder's diplomatic
hideaway for "journalistic" reasons - and later refused to discuss the meeting
because it was "personal."

Donald Trump tweeted a word that's not a word and Twitter can't cope - here are
the best 'Covfefe' reactions

Farage put a stop to the astonishing interview after the journalist refused to
stick to the subject of the UK economy.

He denied having received funding for his Brexit campaign from Russian sources,
insisting donations came from UK individuals.

He said: "No Russian money at all. That's ridiculous. What you are talking about
is conspiracy. I never received a penny from Russia. I wouldn't have taken it,
even if it had been offered. The campaign wasn't about money. It was about
messages, good clear messages."

He admitted he had been paid from Moscow's state TV station Russia Today "which
I do twice a year. Or three times last year. I am doing global media. I am
talking to you as well."

White House mystery as bizarre footage shows red flashing lights sparking wild
online speculation

Asked about the purpose of his meeting with Julian Assange, the paper reports
Farage "stopped for a moment to think."

When he left the Embassy following his meeting, he told reporters he "couldn't
remember" why he had been there.

But he told Zeit he made the visit for "journalistic reasons" - refusing to
elaborate any further.

He said: "It has nothing to do with you. It was a private meeting."

Donald Trump slammed for treating climate change with 'utter contempt'

The FBI probe is centred on claims Russian agents hacked the emails of key
staffers for the Hillary Clinton campaign, which were then given to Wikileaks
who published them online.

Questions have also been raised about contact between former National Security
Advisor Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador to the US in the run up to the
election.

And it's been reported Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, wishing to open up a
"back channel" to Russian government insiders.

HEADLINE: Exxon must report on climate risks

BYLINE: Jillian Ambrose

BODY:

EXXONMOBIL'S shareholders have defeated the US oil giant in their battle to
force the company to face up to the financial risks of tackling climate change.

Almost two thirds of shareholders voted in favour of a motion asking the company
to report on how its business will be affected by worldwide efforts to reduce
carbon emissions. In particular, investors want Exxon to consider the impact of
a strong global commitment to cap global warming at no more than two degrees
above pre-industrial levels.

This could require a sharp turn away from oil, and potentially leave its oil
assets stranded.

The resolution was put forward by the New York State Common Retirement Fund and
the Church Commissioners for England. The pair secured the support of major
institutional investors including Aegon Asset Management, Aviva Investors and
Axa Investment Management.

Thomas DiNapoli, the comptroller for the state of New York, said: "Climate
change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has
direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil."

HEADLINE: EU and China chastise Trump over climate;
Unprecedented rebuke for president after reports that he will pull US out of
Paris deal to cut global warming

BYLINE: Harriet Alexander

BODY:

THE European Union and China will deliver an unprecedented rebuke to Donald
Trump tomorrow, after reports emerged yesterday that he planned to pull the
United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The United Nations deal, backed by 195 countries, aims to cap global warming at
two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels through cuts to carbon emissions.
The EU and China will declare that they have "the highest political commitment"
to the Paris Agreement and "call on all parties to uphold it", in a united
stance aimed at isolating the US on the world stage.

In a veiled condemnation of the US president, the EU and China will demand an
even lower cap than two degrees. They will also promise to work together on
global strategies including cooperation on green legislation, according to
documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph.

"[We] are determined to forge ahead with further policies and measures," the
statement will say.

Climate change and the shift to clean energy is "an imperative more important
now than ever", a threat to national security, and a contributing factor to
instability and the displacement of people, according to the document.

The statement yokes together climate change and free trade - two of Mr Trump's
biggest bugbears - in what is, despite the diplomatic language, a clear
criticism of his policies.

It calls for more free trade to allow the development of an economy low in
greenhouse gas emissions. The statement is a major concession from the EU, which
has trade defence measures on imports of Chinese solar panels.

"The world can count on Europe to keep global climate leadership," tweeted
Miguel Arias Canete, EU Climate Commissioner, who was the chief EU negotiator in
talks with China. "Together, we will stand by Paris."

Tomorrow's statement was originally planned as a way of heaping pressure on Mr
Trump to observe the legally binding deal, but it will take on added
significance after reports of Mr Trump's decision.

The president, who in 2012 described climate change as a hoax invented by China,
campaigned on a promise to take America out of the agreement.

After the website Axios reported that he was about to pull the US out of the
agreement, he tweeted that he had not yet made up his mind, adding last night
that he would announce his decision "very soon".

He said he had been hearing from people on both sides of the issue, but did not
indicate whether he had made up his mind. "I'm hearing from a lot of people,
both ways. Both ways," he said.

If the US does withdraw, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only
non-participants in the Paris Agreement. Russia has signed the deal, but has not
ratified it.

Mr Trump has argued the deal will cost the US economy trillions of dollars
without tangible benefit. It would also reflect his "America First" approach to
policy. A week ago, 20 Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell, senator
for the coal state of Kentucky, wrote to Mr Trump urging him to withdraw from
the deal. They said it would create "burdensome regulations".

But it will also set him against public opinion - 61 per cent of Americans said
the US should uphold the agreement, according to a Huffington Post/You-Gov poll
on May 17.

Antonio Guterres, the UN secretarygeneral, warned in New York on Tuesday about
the perils of undermining the deal. "The world is in a mess," he said. "It is
essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement." Mr Trump's
predecessor, Barack Obama, was an enthusiastic cheerleaders for the Paris deal.
On signing it last September, he said: "We've transformed the United States into
a global leader in the fight against climate change."

Agreement'

HEADLINE: Amateur snaps can save puffins;
Nature notes

BODY:

The RSPB is calling on photographers to help save UK puffins.

Numbers of the birds have plummeted in recent years, with scientists predicting
more than half will disappear in the next 40 years.

Climate change is thought to be a big factors, impacting puffins' food supply
and threatening their survival.

Experts at the RSPB are asking the public to snap images of the birds as they
carry fish to help scientists discover more about what they feed their chicks,
their foraging habits and how their numbers are changing.

Once uploaded to the Project Puffin webpage, scientists will analyse the photos
to build a picture of what puffins in the UK and Ireland are feeding their
pufflings, and perhaps learn more about why some colonies are thriving whilst
others struggle.

The RSPB will also use GPS to track puffins to find out where they go to feed,
and carry out a puffin census.

HEADLINE: Corbyn loses debate gamble as he is caught in crossfire;
Election 2017 The Telegraph Election 2017

BYLINE: Gordon Rayner; Kate McCann; Edward Malnick

BODY:

JEREMY CORBYN'S last-minute gamble of taking part in the BBC leaders' debate
backfired last night when he came under sustained attack from all sides over
terrorism, migration and spending.

The Labour leader - who had previously said he would sit out the televised
debates - announced just hours before the event in Cambridge that he had changed
his mind. He had hoped the ploy would expose Theresa May, who was being
represented by Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, but found himself caught in the
cross-fire between the six other participants.

Mr Corbyn's worst moment came when he refused to described the Manchester
suicide bomber as a terrorist, leaving him struggling to form a sentence as he
said the attack happened "because somebody decided they wanted to go and kill a
large number of people".

He was responding to condemnation from the other party leaders of his suggestion
last week that British foreign policy was partly to blame for the bombing. Ms
Rudd, the Home Secretary, pointed out that as recently as 2011 Mr Corbyn had
boasted of opposing "every piece of anti-terror legislation in his 30 years" as
an MP.

On migration, Mr Corbyn was accused by the SNP Westminster leader Angus
Robertson of adopting Ukip's policies by promising "managed migration" to end
the exploitation of workers. And on his plans for the funding of £50 billion of
extra public spending, Ms Rudd suggested he had adopted "fantasy" economics,
with policies paid for with a "magic money tree".

Also taking part in the debate were Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, Ukip
leader Paul Nuttall and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.

Leadership Mr Corbyn said leadership was about understanding people, protecting
them, and caring for everyone.

Mr Nuttall said he doesn't "flip flop" and had always followed the principle
that Britain should leave the EU.

The Home Secretary added that part of being a good leader was having a strong
team - justifying her appearance at the debate instead of Mrs May. She pointed
out that in a vote of no confidence four out of five Labour MPs had failed to
support Mr Corbyn. "300,000 people elected me to lead this party," he replied,
to audience applause.

Ms Lucas, Ms Wood and Mr Farron used the opportunity to continue attacks on Mrs
May for failing to take part in the debate. "The first rule of leadership is to
show up," said Ms Lucas. Mr Robertson said this was a "totally unnecessary
election" and called Mrs May "the U-turn Queen".

Economy and taxation Ms Rudd said the Conservatives had a strong record on the
economy which allowed the party to ensure people "keep more of the wages they
earn".

She warned that Mr Corbyn has a "fanciful" list of things he would like to spend
money on but no means of funding them. She said: "He has this money tree wish
list in his manifesto... it's very easy to think about how you'd spend money but
much harder to think about how you raise money. This is people's hard earned
money, we will protect that, we won't roll the dice."

The Labour leader hit back and claimed living standards have fallen over the
past seven years. "Have you seen the levels of poverty that exist because of
your Government's conscious decisions on benefits?," he said."We cannot go on
giving money away to the very rich ... instead I say turn it round and invest in
the future of our people."

Public spending Ms Lucas said the Green Party would scrap HS2 and nuclear
weapons and raise taxes for those with "the broadest shoulders" to fund public
spending.

The point was echoed by Mr Corbyn, who said he would protect 95 per cent of
people from increases in their tax bill but those at the top would pay more. But
he was challenged by Ms Wood over Labour's record in Wales after he vowed to
scrap tuition fees. The Plaid leader asked why this policy was not already
implemented in Wales where Labour is in power. Mr Corbyn was unable to answer.

The Home Secretary was laughed at by the audience when she asked voters to judge
her on her record in Government so far, but she received applause for stating
that the biggest danger to the economy would be to ruin the Brexit negotiations.

Mr Robertson pushed Ms Rudd to respond to questions about how much pensioners
might lose in benefits if the Conservatives are re-elected. She replied:
"Theresa May may not be here but I hope to make a good fist of setting out our
policy".

Climate change Every leader except Ukip's Mr Nuttall agreed that it was a bad
thing for the rest of the world that Donald Trump has decided to pull out of the
Paris climate change agreement. Mr Nuttall said the US president is putting his
country first and called for Britain to do the same.

Ms Lucas said she had struggled to get climate change onto the election agenda
while the Home Secretary, who led the Paris climate change agreement talks, said
she was "disappointed" by Mr Trump's decision.

Migration Asked how the parties would ensure Britain has "the workers and skills
we need" to make the country a success, Mr Nuttall said the country's borders
needed to be controlled. Mr Farron warned against "demonising immigrants". Ms
Rudd said immigration was an "important part" of strengthening the economy but
said "we need to make sure we have an immigration policy we can control".

Mr Corbyn was repeatedly asked by Mishal Husain whether he would pledge to cut
immigration. He said that following Brexit "free movement will end" but Labour
would guarantee that those EU citizens already in Britain could stay. He added
that "managed migration" was necessary to prevent problems in communities caused
by the "exploitation of workers".

Ms Wood said she wanted to ensure EU workers in Wales could stay. Mr Robertson
said he was more concerned with the people Scotland was "losing".

Security Mr Robertson cited the "horror" of the attack in Manchester, saying it
was important to invest in the police and that Mr Corbyn's link between foreign
policy and domestic attacks was "dangerous". Mr Corbyn said that under Ms Rudd
and Mrs May 20,000 police officers had lost their jobs and "I think it's
important that we restore that."

Ms Rudd said the first job of any government was to keep the public safe and
secure and that the Conservatives had increased the budgets of security
services. The Home Secretary was "shocked" that Mr Corbyn had boasted of
opposing every piece of anti-terror legislation since becoming an MP. Mr Corbyn
pointed out that Mrs May and other Conservatives had also opposed some
anti-terror legislation because of concerns they had.

Mr Nuttall said the war in Iraq and the air strikes in Libya were wrong, but the
cause of domestic attacks was " Islamist extremism".

Ms Lucas said Britain needed intelligence-led policing and "community
engagement". She also asked why Britain was selling arms to so many countries,
including Saudi Arabia.

Audience bias The BBC was forced to defend the way it gathered audience members
for the debate after there were loud cheers for Left-wing candidates while Amber
Rudd and Paul Nuttall were booed. The official press office Twitter account
replied to a journalist who claimed the audience did not seem balanced by
saying: "The BBC asked polling company ComRes to pick an audience that is
representative of the country demographically and politically."

The key quotes Election gets personal Caroline Lucas "The first rule of
leadership is to show up."

Amber Rudd "This is people's hard-earned money [Corbyn plans to spend], we will
protect that, we won't roll the dice."

Jeremy Corbyn "Have you seen the levels of poverty that exist because of your
government's conscious decisions on benefits?" Leanne Wood "We all know about
blokes like you. [Paul Nuttall] In the real world there's no such thing as a
free divorce. You have to pay your dues [to the EU]."

Tim Farron "Where do you think Theresa May is tonight? Take a look out your
window. She might be out there sizing up your house to pay for your social
care."

Paul Nuttall "Our foreign policy isn't an excuse for what went on in
Manchester."

Angus Robertson "This debate [on immigration] shames and demeans us all."

'Theresa May may not be here but I hope to make a good fist of setting out our
policy'

HEADLINE: EU and China chastise Trump over climate;
Unprecedented rebuke for president after reports that he will pull US out of
Paris deal to cut global warming

BYLINE: Harriet Alexander

BODY:

THE European Union and China will deliver an unprecedented rebuke to Donald
Trump tomorrow, after reports emerged yesterday that he planned to pull the
United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The United Nations deal, backed by 195 countries, aims to cap global warming at
two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels through cuts to carbon emissions.
The EU and China will declare that they have "the highest political commitment"
to the Paris Agreement and "call on all parties to uphold it", in a united
stance aimed at isolating the US on the world stage.

Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, who helped negotiate the Paris agreement while
she was Climate Change Secretary, said she was "disappointed" by Mr Trump's
stance.

"It is disappointing that the Americans are pulling out but I hope that we can
use our relationship with President Trump and our close relationship with the US
to try and influence, to try and make sure that they nevertheless take the right
steps," she said.

In a veiled condemnation of the US president, the EU and China will demand an
even lower cap than two degrees.

They will also promise to work together on global strategies including
cooperation on green legislation, according to documents obtained by The Daily
Telegraph.

"[We] are determined to forge ahead with further policies and measures," the
statement will say.

Climate change and the shift to clean energy is "an imperative more important
now than ever", a threat to national security, and a contributing factor to
instability and the displacement of people, according to the document.

The statement yokes together climate change and free trade - two of Mr Trump's
biggest bugbears - in what is, despite the diplomatic language, a clear
criticism of his policies.

It calls for more free trade to allow the development of an economy low in
greenhouse gas emissions. The statement is a major concession from the EU, which
has trade defence measures on imports of Chinese solar panels.

"The world can count on Europe to keep global climate leadership," tweeted
Miguel Arias Canete, EU Climate Commissioner, who was the chief EU negotiator in
talks with China. "Together, we will stand by Paris."

Tomorrow's statement was originally planned as a way of heaping pressure on Mr
Trump to observe the legally binding deal, but it will take on added
significance after reports of Mr Trump's decision.

After the website Axios reported that he was about to pull the US out of the
agreement, he said that he had not yet made up his mind, adding last night that
he would announce his decision "very soon".

He said he had been hearing from people on both sides of the issue, but did not
indicate whether he had made up his mind. "I'm hearing from a lot of people,
both ways. Both ways," he said.

Mr Trump has argued the deal will cost the US economy trillions of dollars
without tangible benefit. A week ago, 20 Republican senators, including Mitch
McConnell, senator for the coal state of Kentucky, wrote to Mr Trump urging him
to withdraw from the deal. But it will set him against public opinion - 61 per
cent of Americans said the US should uphold the agreement, according to a
Huffington Post/YouGov poll on May 17.

Antonio Guterres, the UN secretarygeneral, warned in New York on Tuesday about
the perils of undermining the deal. "The world is in a mess," he said. "It is
essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement." Mr Trump's
predecessor, Barack Obama, was an enthusiastic cheerleaders for the Paris deal.
On signing it last September, he said: "We've transformed the United States into
a global leader in the fight against climate change."

Agreement'

HEADLINE: Greens in call for US sanctions

BYLINE: TREVOR QUINN

BODY:

THE Green Party yesterday called for the EU to consider penalties against the US
if Donald Trump withdraws from a climate agreement.

Party leader Eamon Ryan TD said: "We were aware President Trump was considering
pulling out of the Paris Climate accord but his reported decision to do just
that is truly shocking.

"He is making America a rogue state, that is now shamed within the international
community.

"Further unchecked releases of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere threatens
all of us.

"For one of the major polluters to abandon their responsibility is an attack on
every other country and on every generation to come.

"Our Government must come together with our European colleagues to consider what
sanctions we should apply on the US administration.

"We cannot keep treating the US as a friendly ally when there is such reckless
disregard for international co-operation and our common future security."

HEADLINE: US ready to 'drop climate change deal'

BODY:

DONALD Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, defying almost
every other country's policy on climate change. Two senior US officials,
familiar with the President's plans, are reported to be claiming that he will
honour his election pledge.

The departure of the States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter,
will not end the 195-nation pact. But countries that reluctantly signed could
ease their commitments on pollution.

Trump, who argues the global plan harms the US economy and job creation,
tweeted: "I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few
days."

He has vowed to rebuild the country's coal mining industry while putting
"America first".

The Paris Agreement tackles the level of emissions to avoid temperature changes
and limit global warming to well below 2C.

DONALD Trump is nearly 71 but he should worry about the world he's creating for
his children, grandchildren and future generations.

The polluter's friend will be guilty of a grave sin if he pulls the US out of a
Paris climate change deal reducing carbon emissions when his stupidity would

Freak man-made extreme weather swings triggered by global warming are a real

HEADLINE: Trump pressured me to axe inquiry;
Sacked FBI chief to testify that president badgered him over Russia links probe

BYLINE: CHRIS BUCKTIN

BODY:

THE sacked director of the FBI will confirm Donald Trump badgered him to drop
the inquiry into his election team's ties to Russia.

James Comey is due to testify as early as next week before the Senate, according
to US reports.

The FBI boss was sacked last month, days after requesting an increase in money
and staff for the probe into links the US president's election team had with
Moscow.

Initially, the White House said Comey had been fired over his handling of the
inquiry into Hillary Clinton's use of an unsecured server to send classified
emails.

However, a day later, Trump said it was his decision. The president allegedly
told Russian officials in the Oval Office: "I just fired the head of the FBI. He
was crazy, a real nutjob."

Comey has spoken to special counsel Robert Mueller, an ex-FBI director appointed
as an independent investigator into Russia's alleged election links.

Sources say Comey is unlikely to speak about the FBI inquiry in detail when he
appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

But it is understood he will discuss his dealings with Trump before he was
sacked. The US leader has been accused of trying to obstruct the Russian
inquiry, leading some Democrats to call for his impeachment.

Trump said the probe was "the single greatest witch-hunt of a politician in
American history".

Already, it has emerged several of Trump's aides had 18 previously undisclosed
discussions with Moscow officials in the seven months before the election.

They included ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn who was fired, Trump
said, after failing to disclose his links with Moscow.

Flynn had been secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the
campaign. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,
defying almost every other country's policy on tackling climate change.

Two senior US officials, familiar with the president's plans, claim he will
honour his election pledge.

The departure of the States, the world's secondlargest greenhouse gas polluter,
will not end the 195-nation pact. But other countries could ease their
commitments on pollution.

Trump, who says the plan harms the US economy, tweeted: "I'll be announcing my
decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days."

HEADLINE: THE TRENDY WOOD PELLET STOVES THAT ARE BAD FOR THE PLANET

BYLINE: BY TAMMY HUGHES

BODY:

TRENDY wood pellet stoves are bad for the environment, according to a forester
who thinks trees feel pain and talk to each other.

Peter Wohlleben said forests can easily combat the effects of climate change by
consuming water - cooling the surrounding temperature by around three degrees.

But companies selling wood pellets as fuel, which are thought to be good for the
environment because they release less carbon dioxide, are making the problem
worse by chopping down trees that could temper the problem.

Wood pellets are a compressed form of wood used in stoves as an eco-friendly
alternative to fossil fuels. Mr Wohlleben, a published author, said the pellets
from southeastern US factories did not reduce carbon dioxide and the idea behind
this was nonsense'.

He also criticised the supposedly eco-friendly policy of power stations
replacing coal with wood pellets. He said: We destroy forests to prevent climate
change but we should leave forests because if it is one, two, three degrees
warmer in future, that is not a problem for forests.'

Mr Wohlleben has studied trees and believes they raise children', sweat, feel
pain and communicate with each other.

In a wide-ranging talk at the Hay Festival, he said: Trees sweat together to
cool down - as we do. A big beech tree can consume up to 500 litres of water a
day.

An unmanaged beech forest can cool down an average of three degrees more than a
managed beech forest. So they create their own climate.

An untouched forest in Europe won't have a problem with climate change.' Mr
Wohlleben also said trees shed their leaves in the autumn because snow will make
the branches break, causing them pain.

Just like humans, trees also need to sleep at night and street trees are dying
earlier because they are sleep deprived, he said.

Mr Wohlleben said: Trees that live near street lights will die earlier because
it's like burning a light in your bedroom.'

Mr Wohlleben was a state forester but now looks after a forest on behalf of the
community in Hummel, Germany, where machinery is banned and the trees are left
alone. His book, The Hidden Life Of Trees, sold out within minutes of the talk.

Britain's largest power station, Drax in North Yorkshire, received more than
£450?million in subsidies in 2015 for burning biomass, which was mostly US wood
pellets.

HEADLINE: TRUMP ON THE BRINK OF PULLING US OUT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE DEAL

BYLINE: BY COLIN FERNANDEZ SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT

BODY:

DONALD Trump is poised to withdraw the US from a major climate change deal, it
was reported yesterday.

A White House official said he is ready to pull America out of the Paris Accord,
which in 2015 united most of the world in a single agreement to mitigate climate
change.

The president claimed before taking office that climate change was a hoax'
created by the Chinese to hurt the US economy. He said it was bad for US
business' because it allowed foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we
use'.

His reversal from previous US policy could put the plan aiming to limit global
warming to no more than 2C in jeopardy - and leave the US isolated among major
nations in opposing the pact.

Mr Trump pledged to abandon the deal during his campaign - but has faced
considerable pressure to stay, including from French president Emmanuel Macron
and Pope Francis.

Mr Trump posted on Twitter yesterday: I will be announcing my decision on the
Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!',

While he currently favours an exit, he has been known to change his thinking on
major decisions and tends to seek counsel from a range of inside and outside
advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute.

Ivanka Trump, his daughter and close adviser, is understood to be a strong
supporter of the Paris accord.

However, his senior aides have been divided on the accord.

Nearly 200 nations, including the US under Barack Obama, agreed in 2015 to
voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change.

The accord was signed by 195 countries out of 197 in a UN group on climate
change, with just Syria and Nicaragua abstaining. To date, 147 out of the 197
countries have ratified the accord, including the US.

A senior European Union official said the EU and China would reaffirm their
commitment to the pact regardless of what Mr Trump does, and spell out, during
talks on Friday in Brussels, how they would meet their obligations.

News of Mr Trump's expected decision drew swift reaction from the United
Nations.

The organisation's main Twitter page quoted secretary-general Antonio Guterres
as saying: Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate
solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.' Bob Ward, policy director
at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics said: A
withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is likely to make it more difficult for the
United States Government and companies to make trade and business deals with
their counterparts in other countries where there is greater understanding of
the risks of climate change.'

Elon Musk, the tech billionaire, tweeted earlier this month that he spoke with
Trump about sticking with the deal. Yesterday he threatened to leave the White
House advisory councils if Trump drops the Paris accord. A senior White House
official yesterday cautioned that the specific language of the president's
expected announcement was still in flux.

Unnamed officials told US media that the withdrawal might come with legal
caveats that will shape the impact of Mr Trump's decision.

RUDE chef Gordon Ramsay claims on US TV's The Late Show that the Queen uses the
kind of fruity language he favours. Receiving his OBE in 2006 from HM, he says,
I got a little handshake and a polite f*** off,' adding: She sort of mutters it
under her breath.' Warning: Ramsay, 50, is currently plugging a new series of
his TV show, The F Word.

BBC3's documentary The Man Who Lives with a Magpie stars Charlie Gilmour, 27,
who was jailed for four months for violent disorder after swinging from a Union
flag during protests at the Cenotaph six years ago and leaping on to the bonnet
of a Jaguar in a royal convoy. He discusses Benzene, a stray magpie who
defecates in his hair while living with him and his wife, Janina, marvelling:
The bigger she grew, the more she s***, until our bedroom became this world of
bird s*** and the rotting dog food we feed her.' Would the BBC broadcast this
rubbish - albeit only online - if barmy-sounding Gilmour wasn't the son of Pink
Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and novelist Polly Samson?

DISCUSSIONS are under way about a royal presence at Sunday's benefit concert,
again starring Ariana Grande, for the victims of the May 22 Manchester bombing.
The presence of William and/or Harry would be appropriate. In 2007, they
organised the fundraising concert starring Sir Elton John to mark the tenth
anniversary of their mother's death.

FORMER government minister Greg Barker - now life peer Baron Barker of Battle -
campaigns on behalf of ex-Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who hopes to win back his
Richmond Park seat. Barker, 51, is accompanied by his loyal dachshund Otto,
pictured. Barker attracted adverse comment while climate change minister for
heating Otto's pillow in his office microwave.

PRINCESS Anne's son, Peter Phillips, attending the London Food Month party in
the City, says: I'm like Bear Grylls, a bit of a hunter-gatherer. My wife
(Canadian Autumn Kelly) gets slightly upset when I bring a rabbit back and skin
it on the kitchen table.' His unsentimental mother would wring a reindeer's neck
if necessary.

BBC newscaster Huw Edwards, 55, is quietly fuming about the corporation's
decision to renege on a promise to grant him overnight anchoring of the June 8
general election results programme. Instead, David Dimbleby, 78, lands the job
for the tenth time. Have you seen the ousted Edwards since?' inquires Radio
Times. No, we never meet, actually,' replies Dimbleby. Edwards tells friends: I
might say more when the time is ripe.'

PRINCE Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle seek a des res' in the
countryside, ideally close to William and Kate's Anmer Hall, which is part of
the Queen's Sandringham estate. How about the Bachelor's Cottage, once a refuge
for excess male guests at Sandringham, renamed York Cottage when it was given to
the future George V and Queen Mary? Currently it's office accommodation but it's
being considered a possible rustic roost for Harry and Meghan.

HEADLINE: ¦ Anglesey's Red-backed Shrike PICTURE: [...]

BYLINE: Julian Hughes

BODY:

¦ Anglesey's Red-backed Shrike PICTURE: MARTIN JONES OF the dozen or so birds
that we've lost as breeding species in Wales in the last century, the Red-backed
Shrike is one of the most striking.

It is suspected that a changing climate combined with new agricultural practices
to end its presence here.

Regular nesting ceased in Wales in the 1950s, though a couple of nests in the
1980s gave false hope of a return.

A few Red-backed Shrikes turn up as passing migrants, brought on southeasterly
winds, but, a male at Anglesey's Penrhos Coastal Park was still a Bank Holiday
weekend surprise, with some birders lucky to hear it singing, as well as viewing
this smart bird.

While some birds have been lost, others have arrived; last week the RSPB
revealed that Cattle Egrets are nesting on the Dee Estuary, just a few hundred
metres beyond the Welsh border.

This follows an influx of the Mediterranean heron into western UK. Burton Mere
Wetlands is only the third location where Cattle Egrets have nested in Britain.
¦ Cattle Egrets nest high in trees, but Little Terns lay their eggs on beaches,
vulnerable to the sea.

High tides east of Prestatyn washed away some of the 100 nests at the only Welsh
colony, but others were saved by Denbighshire Council staff and volunteers
lifting eggs onto platforms, which the parent birds quickly re-adopted.

Subsequent effort was required to clear tidal debris caught in fences that
protect the terns from ground-predators.

Other highlights this week were Little Stints at Gronant and Cemlyn Bay, Turtle
Doves on the Great Orme and Bardsey, two Spoonbills on the Alaw estuary, and a
White-tailed Eagle over Criccieth on Friday.

News emerged last week of a Dark-eyed Junco, a North American seed-eater,
photographed in a Dolgellau garden earlier this month. ¦ 20 birding events are
on the Daily Post website.

HEADLINE: » Upland farms must be hi tech

BODY:

TECHNOLOGY and science will be key to the fortunes of upland farms in Wales,
according to NFU Cymru.

The union's LFA Board said the need for upland farmers to be equipped with the
right tools has "never been greater".

As well as producing more food, hill farmers will need to address climate change
whilst protecting the environment - and possibly with fewer support payments,
said board chairman John Owen.

"In Wales, we need to increase productivity whilst improving resource efficiency
so that the industry can achieve more from less," he said.

NEW BATTLEGROUNDS OPEN UP IN GENERAL ELECTION 2017

BODY:

By ANDREW FORGRAVE Rural Affairs Editor farming@dailypost.co.uk STRIP out Brexit
from party manifestos and you are left with plenty of common farming themes and
a handful of polar opposites.

All the parties say they want a strong and prosperous agricultural sector. Most
want to empower the Groceries Code Adjudicator, boost rural sustainability,
spend more on agri science and improve rural broadband.

Fox hunting and badger culling continues to be divisive, as you would expect,
and this time new battlegrounds have opened up over fracking and neonicotinoid
crop sprays.

A few policy pledges stand out. Labour wants to reinstate the Agricultural Wages
Board, Plaid is promising to reinstate Welsh red meat levies. The latter also
wants a new Wildlife Act for Wales. The Lib Dems aim to encourage new entrants,
while UKIP plans a subsidy cap to support small farms, with extra help for hill,
organic and antibiotic-free enterprises. The Green Party is pledging to "restore
the uplands".

The Tories are categorically promising to hold subsides at current levels -
until 2022 - while Plaid goes further by insisting farm payments in Wales will
remain the same.

But for many, Brexit will remain the key issue. UKIP and the Tories want a hard
landing, the others soft. The Lib Dems are pledging the environmental and
welfare proofing of future food trade deals, while Plaid wants a veto to protect
domestic farming interests.

Tariff-free trade deals and future farm funding are the focus of the unions'
election demands too, along with transitional arrangements, common frameworks
and labour requirements.

WELSH TORIES ¦ Commit to funding farm support until 2022.

¦ A new agri-environment system, to be introduced in the following parliament. ¦
Increase the public sector procurement of local produce. ¦ A voluntary code of

revaluations are conducted more frequently. ¦ Develop the shale gas industry.

¦ Increase spending on research and development. ¦ A free vote on hunting.

WELSH LABOUR ¦ Expand the role of the Groceries Code Adjudicator. ¦ Reconfigure
funds for farming and fishing to support smaller traders and local economies.

¦ Allow EU workers employed in farming, fishing and food processing to remain in
the UK. ¦ Reinstate the Seasonal Agricultural Workers scheme. ¦ Re-instate the
Agricultural Wages Board.

¦ Defend and extend existing environmental protections. ¦ End all badger
culling. ¦ Maintain bans on fox hunting, deer hunting and hare coursing.

FARMER FURY OVER £25,000 GLASTIR PAYMENT

BYLINE: ANDREW FORGRAVE

BODY:

A MID Wales farmer owed £25,000 in Glastir payments has blasted government
officials for leaving him mired in uncertainty.

Ceredigion beef and lamb producer Huw Davies, 51, said his business had been
left in limbo during the long wait for his Glastir Advanced cheque.

Under the terms of the land management scheme, he has built a 180-metre stone
wall, planted 250 metres of hedges and fenced off areas of woodland.

Last year he was paid by April but this time he is still waiting. And with his
Single Payment later than usual this year, Mr Davies said things were now "tight
financially".

He said: "Despite all of the work carried out we have still not been reimbursed
for income foregone, which by now adds up to £25,000.

"It means we can't invest in the business or pay our contractors.

"It is very frustrating and almost impossible to plan ahead or even fill out
your tax forms, when you might end up getting two payments in the same financial
year or none at all."

The Welsh Government has pledged to pay all but the most complex cases "in the
coming weeks".

Glastir payments began on January 20 and so far more than three-quarters of
claims have been settled.

A spokesman said priority had been given to processing Basic Payments Scheme
(BPS) cheques as the value and number of claims was far greater than under
Glastir.

In response to criticism, the administration has repeatedly stressed there is no
finite payment window for Glastir, and therefore by definition payments cannot
be described as "late".

This drew short shrift from Dr Nick Fenwick, the FUW's head of policy, who
joined union members and Plaid AM Simon Thomas on a recent visit to Mrs Davies'
farm.

He said the industry had been incensed by Cardiff's argument, as ¦ The farm's
this implied officials could "sit on payments" for as long as they wanted.

As the Glastir scheme was designed to compensate farmers for costs incurred, it
was only fair that payments were made within a reasonable time period, he said
"The Welsh Government regularly writes to farmers giving them 30 days to repay
sums which have been incorrectly paid," said Dr Fenwick.

"If Welsh Ministers believe this is a reasonable time period, then they should
follow the same principle, especially where costs have been incurred.

"Based on such a period, many hundreds of Glastir payments owed by the
government are now more than three months late."

Mr Davies, a former student at Coleg Llysfasi, Ruthin, runs 900-acre Llety Ifan
Hen, Bontgoch, with his father Emyr.

Together they manage 1,500 ewes, new turbine 400 replacement ewe lambs, 40
suckler cows and followers, and 20 store cattle.

With farmgate prices down and future farm support uncertain, last June they
decided to diversify into renewable energy and built a 500kW wind turbine.

The process was not straightforward, admitted Huw.

"The planning was incredibly complicated," he said. "Without our consultant we
would not have stood a chance of making this happen."

Mid and West Wales AM Simon Thomas, who sits on the Assembly's climate change,
environment and rural affairs committee, was told by the FUW delegation that the
process needs to be made easier for farmers.

The return of feed-in tariffs would also sweeten the deal for potential
applicants, added Huw.

"It has to be easy and attractive for people if they are to engage with
diversifications," he said.

"We are lucky. Our turbine offers a bit of financial security, especially given
farming's uncertain future with Brexit imminent and no plans in place for future
agricultural support."

HEADLINE: General Election 2017: New Forest proving consistently Conservative

BYLINE: Aaron Shaw

BODY:

TWO Hampshire seats have had the same MPs since they were created 20 years ago -
and Conservatives are going all out to ensure nothing changes.

Veteran Tories Dr Julian Lewis and Sir Desmond Swayne have represented New
Forest East and New Forest West respectively since boundary changes resulted in
the former constituencies of New Forest and Romsey & Waterside being abolished
in 1997.

Two years after retaining their seats in the last general election Dr Lewis and
Sir Desmond are striving to be re-elected once again.

In 2015 Dr Lewis received 19,000 more votes than his closest challenger, UKIP
candidate Roy Swales.

This time UKIP is standing aside in both New Forest seats after deciding not to
field candidates in constituencies held by pro-Brexit MPs.

Issues in the district include soaring house prices, especially those in the
National Park, and the increasingly difficult struggle faced by young people who
want to remain in the area where they grew up.

Foxhunting is back on the agenda after Theresa May pledged a free vote on
whether the Bill outlawing hunting with dogs should be repealed.

The New Forest Hounds have had to stage trail hunting, which involves hounds
chasing an artificial scent, since the Hunting Act came into force in 2005.

Other issues include the large number of animals killed or injured on Forest
roads every year. Campaigners want the 40mph speed limit on all unfenced roads
reduced to 30mph to cut the carnage.

Brexit, climate change and tuition fees are among the other issues being raised
on doorsteps across the district.

In New Forest East many voters are worried about the future of Dibden Bay, an
environmentally-sensitive area of reclaimed coastline between Hythe and
Marchwood.

Controversial plans to turn the 500-acre site into a huge container terminal
were rejected by the last Labour government, but Associated British Ports (ABP)
says Southampton docks needs to expand.

Council chiefs have warned that new plans to develop Dibden Bay could be
unveiled by ABP before the end of the year.

Other issues include the future of Marchwood Military Port, which has been
handed over to a commercial operator by the Ministry of Defence. People living
near the 300-acre site are still waiting to learn what Solent Gateway Ltd is
planning to do with the land.

Dr Lewis's rivals include Liberal Democrat David Harrison, county councillor for
Totton and Marchwood and leader of the opposition group on the district council.

Brockenhurst parish councillor Henry Mellor is standing for the Green Party and
Julie Renyard represents Labour's hopes of winning the seat.

Dr Lewis says only a Conservative victory will deliver a Brexit that works for
the United Kingdom.

But Cllr Harrison claims a hard Brexit is opposed by business leaders because of
what it could mean to Britain's trade and the country's standing in the world.

Julie Renyard says voters in New Forest East are suffering from continuing cuts
and is pledging a better future for everyone if Labour is elected.

Cllr Mellor wants to see increased investment in technology, more action to
combat climate change and a reduction in the voting age to 16.

In New Forest West Sir Desmond is defending a majority of more than 20,000.

The four rival candidates are Labour's Jo Graham, Des Hjerling from the Pirate
Party UK, Green Party member Janet Richards and Liberal Democrat Terry Scriven,
who has previously stood in New Forest East.

Jo Graham said that despite the Forest being a prosperous area many people were
poorly paid and found local housing to be unaffordable.

Mr Hjerling is pledging to put the constituency first, saying he would not be
governed by a party whip and was thus a better choice than the Labour, Liberal
Democrat and Conservative candidates.

Mr Scriven, who has lived in Fordingbridge for 21 years, criticised what he
described as the under-funding of schools in the area.

Janet Richards, a parish councillor at Martin, near Fordingbridge, was the Green
Party candidate in New Forest West in 2015 and received 2,748 votes.

A founder of a local co-operative and community farm, Futurefarms, she describes
herself as "passionate" about the countryside.

She is also pledging, if elected, to do everything she can to keep fracking out
of the New Forest as well as increasing the supply of affordable housing.

HEADLINE: Cuts have had a dire effect on our services

BODY:

HAD the child not landed on her back pack, on grass, she would probably be dead.

The incident, on Lower Road, Bookham, was a few years ago now, but I won't
forget the reaction of a local councillor to this child's being hit by a driver
while she was crossing the road in the late morning: "Should have been at
school."

And should the driver have been at work? Or was the child coming back from the
dentist?

There is now a pedestrian crossing where the car struck the schoolgirl. The
campaign took years. I doubt whether it would succeed today. Budgets were tight
when it was installed in April 2013 but the work went ahead.  Today, Surrey's
finances are so dire that such a project faces impossible odds unless someone -
the usual victim is a child - is killed.

In January 60 residents of nearby Little Bookham Street gathered in their
village hall to ask Surrey and the police to do something about speeding in
their street. They worry about damage to their parked vehicles, and the risks to
children going to and from school from drivers doing 40, 50 or more. Driver
behaviour is often bad beyond telling. Little mention was made of air quality,
but speeding emits far more poison than driving below the limit.

The speedwatch group they set up is now one of 200 or more in Surrey, a measure
of widespread concern about speeding. But the residents have a mountain to
climb. Surrey can only take action with the support of the police and they only
take action where the 85th percentile speed is over 50mph, on main roads. Here
it is 'only' just over 36mph - in a 30mph zone.

Yes, the tide is turning. A sure sign is that many at the meeting were in their
30s, male and female, rather than the pensioners you'd expect. The first hurdle
is police priorities. There's little behind the police 'Drive Smart' PR
campaign. Every Casualty Reduction Officer link on its Community Speedwatch page
(bit.ly/2n9gtCG), including Mole Valley's, is broken.

Police priorities will not change without public insistence. And that means
paying for a better service. Only in an Alice-through-the-Looking-Glass world
can we expect better policing -or any other service - without paying the higher
taxes that implies.

HEADLINE: Let's trust the Tories

BYLINE: Kathy Muir

BODY:

Sir,- While I appreciate that domestic policies are of importance for this
election, the overriding consideration must be the long-term future of the
country. This future depends on the Brexit agreement we arrive at with the EU,
and therefore we should vote for the party whose leader is the most likely to
negotiate the best settlement.



Even if one does not agree with all their domestic policies, these can be
challenged and changed in years to come, but the next few years will determine
our prosperity, or otherwise, for the future.

I venture to suggest that the party we should trust with this task is the
Conservative Party.

R M BURGESS

Woodbridge

Sir,- During this election campaign, I am concerned with who will represent
Ipswich in the next parliament. There are many important local and national
issues at stake.

As a supporter of Catholic aid agency CAFOD, I hope that candidates of all
parties in Ipswich will consider global issues too, and commit to build on
Britain's proud record in looking outwards and working with others to tackle
poverty, inequality and climate change. I have contacted all Ipswich candidates
asking for their views on this but have only received one encouraging reply,
from the Labour candidate, Sandy Martin.

We live in an interconnected world. To say we can't help people at home if we
help them abroad is to present a false choice. We are big enough to do both: it
is who we are and what we stand for.

Mrs ELAINE PATTEN

Ipswich

Sir, - I was born in the early 1950s. Not many families had a motor car.
Normally, the mother couldn't drive and the father may have been able to drive
but couldn't afford a car, so went to work on a bike, moped, bus or walked. â
¨Mother used to have a huge pram for the baby. The pram was big and had a hood
and a storm apron. During autumn and winter baby was snuggled down in the pram
and protected from the elements. During spring and summer the storm apron came
off and was replaced with a beautiful embroiderie anglais canopy which protected
baby from the sun.  â ¨The prams were large and baby could sleep, sit up and
generally move about. There was room in the pram for the general 'baby
paraphernalia'.  Baby could sleep in the pram in the garden - hence plenty of
fresh air.â ¨I had my last child during the early 1980s and had a Silver Cross
pram (other makes were available).  Again, baby could sleep and move about in
the pram. It had a tray underneath for the shopping etc...  I was 32 years old
and used to put my child in the pram and walk from Washbrook into town or
wherever I needed to go.  Baby was quite happy! He could move, sleep, turn
around etc... and, again, was protected from the elements.

I kept the pram and, a few years ago I went with my daughter, son-in-law and two
grandchildren to Colchester Zoo.  It was a blistering hot day, no cloud, wind,
breeze-just wall-to-wall sunshine.  Youngest grandchild was nine months old and
was perfectly comfortable in the pram. The canopy protected him from the sun, he
could lie down and go to sleep or he could sit up and play with his toys.  All
around us were little babies strapped into silly little 'things' with a tiny
parasol for sun protection. Those poor babies! They could only move their arms
and legs (as their bodies were completely strapped down)  and, of course, they
were grizzly and unhappy!

This week we have had some unusually hot weather and I boarded a Number X5 bus
to the hospital and there were two babies each strapped into one of those
'contraptions'.  The poor little mites could only move their arms and legs
about. No toys to play with to distract them. Also what I have noticed is that
the baby is 'facing forward' on most occasions in those 'contraptions' and what
is baby doing - he is facing the world. At that age they are too young to be
facing the world, they should be looking at their mum or dad!

Bring back the 'proper pram'!

Elaine Bamber,

Washbrook.

Sir, - Quite sad that Mr Roy Everett (EADT, May 27) felt it necessary to 'slag
off' socialism here in the UK without a mention of the Tory damage under
Thatcher, with her 'short termism' policies stealing from the nation and selling
off cheaply all of the post war 'utilities' during the 1980s.â ¨These were put
in place by the socialist Attlee government, including the NHS, with borrowing
to help build post war Britain after the dreadful war. â ¨Also, to help the
government treasury and the nation's core income for our basic services and this
is still the case in Europe today. â ¨None of these assets ever belonged to the
Tory party. These, however, were taken from the nation via their campaign for
privatisation. They promoted the purchase of undervalued shares from public
utilities. This was taken up eagerly by some of the public for a quick profit.
These shares were quickly acquired later by city of London share traders
offering a profit. â ¨These shares were then traded in the city and ironically
ended up in Nationalised European public ownership! â ¨Much earlier after the
war, we not only had a huge USA war debt, despite being on the winning side, but
also severe bomb damage and a need for homes. Much like now, a chronic shortage
of affordable homes. Only this time we haven't suffered a war but total
mismanagement of our needs caused by Tory ideology for 'house ownership' and not
building, as in Europe, enough social housing. â ¨Also, Tories have sold all the
core 'utilities', council houses have been discounted, oil, gas, BT, railways,
Post Office, water, Central Electricity Generating Board, Electricity
Distribution networks and the latest, the Gas supply Network. This sold to China
for £11bn. All sold off into mostly foreign hands taking their profits out of
this country.â ¨Panic measures to fund Treasury needs where there is
insufficient income now. â ¨This has all contributed to our decline. Even the
Land Registry office (keeper of our property details) is up for possible
privatisation, I have read, but due to pressure being reconsider, I hope. I am
sick and tired of hearing people say we are the fifth richest country in the
world and yet everything inside is falling apart. Does the government think we
are blind to what is actually happening here in Britain. London based financial
international services might be 'rich' but as a result the infrastructure of
Britain isn't.â ¨Only on Monday evening, during the election debate on TV, a NHS
nurse asked Theresa May, ''although we are the so called fifth richest country
in the world,  why are we only able to put 9.8% of GNP (gross national product)
into healthcare, the lowest of the developed European countries despite knowing
our NHS is falling apart?"  Theresa May said "we can only have a strong NHS when
we have a strong economy"! This will never happen as long as we have constantly
to pay out wage and rent subsidies to the JAMs (the just about managing) in low
paid jobs because of the failed house and employment policies the Tories have
persued over many years.

Bob Hoggar,

Halesworth.

TRUMP is playing hard to get with the Paris climate accord, and this week Green
Party leader Caroline Lucas asked "Where is the Environment?" in the election.
If Theresa May won't listen to Lucas, will she listen to favoured author Donna
Leon? May said she read Leon's crime books on holiday.

Venice-based Leon gets exercised about global warming, and criticised May's
dismantling of the Department of Climate Change last year.

"By God, you just shut that sucker down," she said with surprise, in an email to
us. Could Leon persuade May with literature? "I hope to heaven that the PM of
any nation doesn't need to read about global warming in a crime novel to begin
to consider the possibility that it might be a reality," she replied, curtly.

HEADLINE: Trump and Clinton reignite feud;
He says 'crooked' again, she hits back with 'covfefe'

BYLINE: David Gardner

BODY:

DONALD TRUMP and Hillary Clinton have reignited their bitter White House
election feud by squaring up on social media.

While the president branded his beaten opponent "crooked Hillary" - an insult he
often used on the campaign trail - Mrs Clinton mocked him by using his made-up
word "covfefe".

Mr Trump tweeted: "Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself,
refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC."

In response, Mrs Clinton fired back with her own version of the phrase "people
in glass houses shouldn't throw stones".

The former first lady tweeted: "Peo-ple in covfefe houses shouldn't throw
covfefe." The bizarre non-word went viral yesterday after Mr Trump accidentally
wrote it in a tweet and failed to correct it, with social media awash with jokes
and speculation over its possible meaning.

The president was reacting to remarks made by Mrs Clinton, who told a tech
conference in California's Silicon Valley that she believed Mr Trump may have
"guided" Russian efforts to sabotage her election campaign. Making clear that
she thought he had "colluded" with Moscow, she also blasted the election
coverage on Facebook, saying the "vast majority" of news about her was "fake".

She claimed there were "1,000 Russian agents involved in delivering those
messages" although it was unclear where she obtained her figures.

The row blew up as Mr Trump and his aides were locked in last-minute discussions
over plans to pull the US out of the 2015 Paris climate change accord.

While some insiders insisted the decision had been made to withdraw, others
claimed the move had not been finalised.

After weeks of uncertainty, Mr Trump said he intended to announce his decision
in the White House Rose Garden at 8pm UK time today.

Critics say a withdrawal would harm America's standing in the world and make it
more difficult for Mr Trump to reach agreement with allies on other key issues,
such as trade and terrorism.

Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said he opposed
"behaving as vassals of the Americans" and blasted Mr Trump for failing to
understand the mechanics of a withdrawal, which he said could take three or four
years.

"This notion - 'I am Trump. I am American. America first, so I'm going to get
out of it' - that is not going to happen," he said.

Meanwhile the BBC reported today that Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a
joint statement on the Paris climate agreement, stressing the "highest political
commitment" to implementing the deal.

The statement, seen as a rebuff to the US, will be published tomorrow after a
summit in Brussels.

KENSINGTON'S Tory MP, Victoria Borwick, pictured, might have wished she'd
followed Theresa May's lead and stayed away from Notting Hill last night. The
holy setting of St John's Church didn't inhibit constituents, who booed the
visibly nervous Borwick when she ducked questions on how to tackle Brexit.

"We need to work together," she said. "We're much stronger together than we are
separately". "Answer the f**king question," one guest shouted. Labour candidate
Emma Dent Coad jabbed a finger at Borwick. "She," Coad said scornfully, "voted
against Remain three times - no wonder she can't answer the question". The
audience stamped their feet and heckled Borwick, before Lib-Dem candidate
Annabel Mullin continued. "Nine times she voted against climate change," she
said, referring to Borwick's reluctance to support preventative measures. "Every
breath we take is what she was voting against, I'm asking you to employ me." One
attendee scoffed: "No chance." Mullin shrugged: "I'll take that as a maybe."

HEADLINE: Boris urges Trump to 'show leadership' on climate change

BYLINE: Kate Proctor

BODY:

BORIS JOHNSON today said Britain will continue to pressure Donald Trump into
cutting CO2 emissions ahead of the US president's expected decision to withdraw
from the Paris climate change agreement.

Mr Trump was reportedly preparing to announce tonight he will be pulling America
out of its commitment to the landmark 2015 Paris Accord - a deal spearheaded by
Barack Obama.

His decision has caused alarm around the world, with China's prime minister Li
Keqiang issuing a statement stressing the fight against climate change is an
"international responsibility".

Mr Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, told BBC News: "We want to see America to
continue to show leadership on climate change and in reducing CO2 emissions and
we continue to lobby with the Americans to encourage them to do that."

His concern comes as Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was disappointed by Mr
Trump's stance and would try to influence the country's approach to emissions.

Mr Trump promised to abandon the deal during his election campaign and to boost
fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: Local solutions for a global problem

BYLINE: MATTHEW D'ANCONA

BODY:

CLIMATE OF HOPE: HOW CITIES, BUSINESSES AND CITIZENS CAN SAVE THE PLANET by
Michael Bloomberg and Carl Pope (St Martin's Press, $26.99) MATTHEW D'ANCONA
CITIES can't wait for national governments to act. They must find their own ways
to help people protect themselves affordably." So declares Michael Bloomberg in
this important new book, co-authored with Carl Pope, on the fight against
climate change.

Bloomberg is best-known as a global media magnate and the mayor of New York City
from 2002 to 2013, while Pope is a distinguished environmentalist who was
executive director and chairman of the 125-year old US conservationist group,
the Sierra Club. What makes Climate of Hope distinctive is the fusion of their
respective talents: business sense and a deep familiarity with public policy are
intertwined to great effect with idealism and social responsibility.

The result is a book that eschews the finger-wagging puritanism of many green
texts and concentrates remorselessly upon practical solutions that will not only
help to save the planet but stimulate economic growth and enhance our quality of
life. It liberates discussion of climate change from the phony row between
science and denial, and reframes it in a spirit of pragmatic optimism: what can
be done, efficiently and urgently, and who is best placed to do it? There is
plenty here for national policy-makers, especially on the need to phase out
coal, reform subsidies to fossil fuel producers, disrupt utility monopolies so
that sustainable energy can compete, improve liquidity to encourage
climate-friendly projects (capitalintensive but cheaper in the long run), and
radically increase transparency on climate-change risk.

Yet the authors' central contention is that the grinding, oftenexasperating
debate between national governments is only part of the answer. "More than any
national law or policy," they write, "devolving power to cities is the single
best step that nations can take to improve their ability to fight climate change
and, with it, the health of their citizens and economies."

After Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, Bloomberg responded with more than
250 achievable measures - having already launched "PlaNYC" in 2007, a green
civic initiative, to prepare for such moments. To build resilience, he argues,
cities need to ensure that they have the best possible topographical data and
make intelligent use of it; that insurance premiums are fair and don't force
people from their homes; that utility companies are held accountable for their
conduct during, and preparation for, emergencies; and that developers are
similarly incentivised to build responsibly.

The book also has plenty to say on how enlightened city governance can reduce
emissions in the future, not least by encouraging smart construction as well as
green transport. Bloomberg has been UN special envoy for cities and climate
change since 2014, and is the driving force behind the Global Covenant of Mayors
for Climate and Energy, a coalition of 7,000 cities in 112 countries. Because
mayors are engaged in such a specific and detailed way with the needs of their
cities - and are daily accountable to their voters - they are perfectly placed
between individual citizens who often feel powerless and national governments
that move at a snail's pace in their quest for global collaboration.

Accordingly, there is much here for our own city authorities - and every
newly-elected metro mayor - to learn from. It is a model text for those who
argue that decentralisation works best and that most of the challenges facing
humanity in the 21st century require localised solutions.

But this is emphatically not a tract for policy wonks alone, or purely for those
with an interest in environmentalism. Coursing through every chapter is a
lively, rigorous recognition that we live in a world of hectic change, matched
by an infectious optimism that the challenge can be met. In that sense, the book
is an indispensable manual for our times.

HEADLINE: 'Vote for what you believe in'

BYLINE: by Green candidate Joe Levy; @ExpressandEcho; echonews

BODY:

 TALKING to voters in Exeter I've heard one thing above all else - people are
afraid. Many people want to vote Green, but fear by doing so they will let the
Tories in. This happens every election. We are told that our votes are wasted
unless they are for Labour or Conservative. This is because of our archaic and
undemocratic voting system makes people believe they must vote tactically to
keep another out rather than vote for what they really believe in. We urgently
need change, not just to our electoral system so that all votes count, but also,
we need to be bold; having the courage to vote for the future we really want to
see.

My biggest fear, as a young person, is a future of uncertainty caused by a
Brexit that I didn't vote for. There are also many other pressures facing young
people. Students are now likely to be paying upwards of £9,000 a year, and
education funding from primary school through to university is facing serious
cuts. Youth services are virtually non-existent in Exeter, leaving young people
in some communities totally stranded.  These 'austerity' measures are reducing
opportunities and setting many young people to fail. The Green Party will not
only scrap tuition fees, we will also write-off all existing student debt. We
will also restore student grants, the education maintenance allowance and
properly fund our youth services.

One of the things I have learned as a young person renting in the city is how
difficult it is to find decent and affordable accommodation. It's not just me.
On the doorstep people of all ages have told me about the need for insulation to
help them keep their homes warm and the trouble they have had if they have
complained about damp. And yet despite these uninhabitable conditions, they pay
exorbitant rent.

In Exeter, where wage levels are low, we need rent controls, more secure
tenancies, an end to letting fees and the introduction of mandatory licensing
for all landlords. This would create a fair deal for the city's renters. Exeter
Young Greens have put together a Renters' Charter, setting out how Exeter can
become a more renter-friendly city - including by giving tenants a voice through
a renters' union.

While some may be concerned about taking back control, I'm more interested in
giving control so people can decide their own future. If elected as your MP, I
will back a ratification referendum on Brexit. The referendum on our EU
membership should have been the start of a democratic process, not the end of
it. Democracy needs to go beyond a yes or no question. Rather than a simple
'leave or remain' question, a ratification referendum would put the final Brexit
deal to the public, with the option to remain if we didn't like what was on
offer.

Whatever plot the Brexit story follows, we need to ensure that we aren't left
stranded with a Government that demonises migrants, abandons human rights
legislation, and dismantles environmental protections. Our shorelines, waterways
and countryside have been better for EU protections. There must be a cast iron
guarantee that these protections will continue, which is why the Green Party
proposes a new Environmental Protection Act.

We also need to acknowledge that the greatest threat we will face across our
lifetimes is climate change. I live in low lying St Thomas, and while flood
defences can hold back the water, they are only a sticking plaster approach to
an issue that requires national and international action. While this is
definitely something to fear, action on climate change brings countless new
opportunities for us as a country. Insulating millions of homes will drastically
cut domestic carbon emissions. This will also cut fuel bills, help end fuel
poverty and create new jobs. We need more co-operation with social enterprises
and business as Exeter's high tech sector grows, to seize the opportunity to
invest in renewable energy, creating new jobs and a low carbon city.

Home to the Met Office and a university with leading climate science
specialists, it would be fitting for Exeter to elect an MP that puts taking
action on climate change at the forefront of policy.

It is not always easy to take the long view when so many of us are worried about
how we will pay the rent, the next fuel bill or even for the next meal. The
Green Party is the only party to acknowledge the deep link between social
injustice and environmental injustice. This is why we want to introduce a
government sponsored pilot scheme to take steps towards the introduction of a
basic income for all, as a means to increase security and avoid the poverty
trap.

Now more than ever, we must vote for what we believe in. I am determined to
fight for communities across the city, and as an MP would ensure that Exeter has
a distinctive, powerful and progressive voice in Parliament. I urge you not to
vote for fear. Vote for hope. Vote for evidence based policies that will benefit
both people and planet.

HEADLINE: Theresa May 'disappointed' at Trump's withdrawal from Paris climate
agreement

BYLINE: Aletha Adu

BODY:

THERESA May has disparaged Donald Trump as she expressed her "disappointment" at
his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Accord on climate change.

GETTY

Theresa May disappointed at Donald Trump's withdrawal from Paris agreement

In a phone call, the US President called Mrs May to "discuss his decision to
pull out of the Paris agreement", Downing Street said in a statement.

The Republican said the Paris agreement "front loads costs on American people",
"disadvantages the US" to benefit other countries and causes a "vastly
diminished economic reduction".

He added: "In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America... the United
States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord."

But Number 10 said Mrs May told Trump, "the Paris Agreement provides the right
global framework for protecting the prosperity and security of future
generations, while keeping energy affordable and secure for our citizens and
businesses".

Although the two leaders could not agree on the climate deal, Mrs May and Mr
Trump's special relationship remains in tact as they agreed on the importance of
"continued co-operation on wider energy issues".

But Mrs May has found her self under fire among her national political rivals
for not joining her French, German and Italian counterparts in signing a joint
declaration to decline Mr Trump's demands to negotiate a new deal.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who described Mr Trump's withdrawal as
"profoundly regrettable", said it was an "appalling abdication of leadership by
the PM".

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn mocked the famous photos of Mrs May during her
January visit to Mr Trump in the White House, as he said: "Pulling out of the
Paris climate deal is reckless and regressive. Instead of hand-holding, I'll
work for a sustainable future for our planet."

Nicola Sturgeon blasted May's leadership as appalling

Former Labour leader Ed Miliband joined in the attacks and asked: "Theresa May,
why are you missing from this statement? You can't stand up for Britain because
you won't stand up to Trump. Weak leadership."

Urging Mrs May to use any influence she may have over the US President to make
him change his mind, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron mockingly said: "You
have gone to Washington to hold Donald Trump's hand, now is the time to hold his
feet to the fire.

"We need to make him see sense on climate change. Prime Minister: if your
special relationship with Donald Trump means anything, prove it."

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said "the opprobrium of the world"
should ring in Mr Trump's ears.

She added: "Even earlier today, while Trump's decision hung in the balance and
leaders around the world were pressuring him to do the right thing, all Theresa
May could say was 'It's up to the president to decide'.

GETTY

Ukip's Paul Nuttall inadvertently said Trump can make his own decisions because
he is the President

"That is a total dereliction of her duty, both to our country and our planet,
and it is not just her lack of backbone that has been exposed during this
campaign, but her hopelessness at diplomacy and negotiation."

In a video message from the Elysee Palace, Mr Macron turned Mr Trump's slogan
against him, he said France would continue the fight to "Make our planet great
again".

The French president also invited American climate change scientists, engineers
and entrepreneurs to work in France and continue their work.

Donald Trump is set to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement

US President Donald Trump said the Paris agreement "front loads costs on

"vastly diminished economic reduction".

He will say the decision fulfills his promise to "put American workers first,"
it said.

Mr Trump said he hopes to seek "a better deal" and the current "deal subjects
our citizens to harsh economic restrictions " and "punishes the United States".

Introducing President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence dedicated his speech to
"a president who is fighting everyday to make Amrica great again."

He said: "President Trump is working tirelessly to keep to the promises he made
to the American people.

"Thanks to President Trump, America is back.

He said Trump was putting "American jobs and American consumers first. American

Mr Pence added: "His actions today show he is choosing the forgetten American
men and women first.

SKY NEWS

Trump said the deal 'punishes the US'

The President was scheduled to make the official announcement at 3 pm in the
White House Rose Garden.

An American withdrawal, promised by Mr Trump during the 2016 US presidential
campaign, would deepen a rift with US allies and align the United States with
Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the 195-nation
accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.

US supporters of the pact said any pullout by Mr Trump would represent an
abdication of American leadership on a leading issue of our time and would show
that the United States cannot be trusted to follow through on international
commitments.

Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global
emissions of "greenhouse" gases.

These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that
scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more
frequent violent storms.

HEADLINE: Merkel ally compares US to Syria in war of words with Donald Trump
over Paris Agreement

BYLINE: Darren Hunt

BODY:

AN ANGELA Merkel ally compared the US to Syria and Nicaragua as Donald Trump
prepares to announce his decision on whether to pull the US out of the Paris
Agreement.

The German ambassador to the United States described Germany as a "staunch
advocate" of the Paris agreement, as Mr Trump is expected to make a decision on
whether he will pull the US out of the global pact.

Peter Wittig said the US will be on the same level as Syria if Donald Trump
decides to all the US out of the Paris Agreement.

Speaking to PBS News, he said: "First of all, as we speak, we don't know what
the decision will be.

"It's no secret we have been a staunch advocate of the Paris Agreement.

"We think it is a landmark achievement, it's an almost universal agreement
containing the global warming, fighting climate change.

"We think it is so important the US stays on board in a leadership role, thanks
to the US this agreement was possible in the first place.

"If the US would leave it would be kind of a self-isolation and the US would
find itself in an odd company, just Syria and Nicaragua are the only countries
not part of the Paris agreement and we don't think that is a good option."

Angela Merkel, 62, told a rally in Munich that Britain and the US could no
longer be trusted by the EU anymore.

The German Chancellor said: "The times in which we could completely depend on
others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days.

"We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands."

Mrs Merkel added that Germany and the EU had to "fight for our destiny" but
would aim to keep good terms with the UK and US.

The US President is preparing to pull the America out of the global pact to
fight the threat of climate change, according to reports.

Mr Trump tweeted that he would make the announcement at 3pm local time in
Washington , adding "MAKE AMERICA GREAT".

President's daughter Ivanka Trump is believed to have urged her father not to
abandon the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the US should keep
a "seat at the table".

The Paris Agreement is a historic global pact to cut greenhouse gases and reduce
emissions in the fight against climate change.

The deal was signed by the leaders of about 200 nations and was the first
legally-binding agreement to tackle climate change on a global scale.

The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said it could
take years to extricate the US from the Paris Agreement.

He said: "I am a transatlantic, but if the American president says in the next
few hours or days he wants to get out of the Paris deal, then it is the duty of
Europe to say this is not the case.

"This is not just about the future of European humanity, it is about the future
of people elsewhere."

HEADLINE: VATICAN IN FLAMES: Fire and thick black smoke billowing above Pope's
walled city

BYLINE: Rebecca Flood

BODY:

PLUMES of dark smoke were seen rising from the walled Vatican City, in Rome, as
a fire raged near the religious site.

According to reports the Pope was inside the Vatican, the heart of the Roman
Catholic Church.

Alarming footage from the scene yesterday showed black smoke pouring into the
sky at a considerable rate.

A large explosion was heard just before plumes of the thick smoke erupted into
the sunny skies above Rome.

Hoardes of firefighters were seen at the auto-garage where the fire started.

Visitors took to social media to express their shock at the scenes unfolding in
the city.

One person simply tweeted: "Vatican on fire".

Another said: "Possible explosion at the Vatican."

A third posted online: "Currently a major fire , heavy smoke, big column of
smoke rises up into the sky."

One eyewitness said they saw smoke, adding: "Then a few minutes later there was
a loud boom and more smoke.

Photos show a fire raging behind a building, and it is said to have taken hold
in the Primavalle district of Rome.

The fire is reportedly coming from a neighbourhood behind the Vatican

Firefighters battled the blaze which engulfed a scrap yard and a crusher.

Some 50 vehicles are thought to have been destroyed in the inferno, after
starting in a car and spending throughout the yard.

The heat set off a series of explosions, sending pieces of cars shooting into
the air.

A nearby building was evacuated while firefighters grappled with the fire.

The fire was coming from a neighbourhood behind the Vatican, and the blaze was
not inside the city walls.

Local reports indicate the fire was at a nearby car pound, and "shrouded a
building".

The home of the Pontiff, the Vatican is the smallest country in the world
measuring just 0.2 square miles.

The Pope recently met with US president Donald Trump, and his wife Melania, in
his first foreign tour.

The pair exchanged gifts, with the Pontiff handing the billionaire a copy of his
2015  encyclical on the effects of climate change.

When deciding on a new Pope the papal conclave, the college of cardinals convene
and the colour of smoke emanating from the Sistine Chapel indicates whether a
decision has been made.

Dark smoke indicates the ballot did not result in a new pope, while white smoke
indicates a new one has been chosen.

HEADLINE: 'China is NOW a strategic partner' Merkel hails German's alliance in

GERMANY and China have vowed to expand their partnership and pledged to continue
fighting climate change, sending a signal to Washington hours before Donald
Trump announces if he will quit a global climate deal.

Germany and China have vowed to expand their partnership and pledged to fight
climate change

Berlin was the first stop in Europe for Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, amid growing
concern in Germany over some of Trump's policies, especially on climate change
and protectionism. He was due to head later for Brussels.

"China has become a more important and strategic partner," Merkel said at a news
conference with Li, pointing to political, economic, social and cultural ties.

Berlin was the first stop in Europe for Chinese Premier Li Keqiang

"We are living in times of global uncertainty and see our responsibility to
expand our partnership in all the different areas and to push for a world order
based on law," she said.

The two held wide-ranging talks on issues from trade, civil rights, the North
Korea crisis and climate change and a multitude of business deals were signed.

"We are both ready to contribute to stability in the world," Li said.

As the world awaits Trump's decision on climate change after he denounced the
Paris pact in his 2016 presidential campaign, Li said China was committed to
tackling the issue, both via the Paris Agreement and by setting national
targets.

"China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change," he told reporters
in Berlin.

GETTY

Angela Merkel said 'China has become a more important and strategic partner'

European and Canadian officials have warned Trump that the U.S. risks ceding
global leadership on combating climate change to China, if it withdraws from the
Paris accord.

Merkel vented her frustration with Trump on Sunday after what she described as
unsatisfactory talks of G7 leaders, saying Germany and Europe could no longer
totally rely on traditional allies. Since then she has hosted Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi as well as Li.

Merkel said she wanted quick progress on an EU-China investment deal and that
this would be a precondition to any free trade talks, a move Li said would be
timely.

With bilateral trade of 170 billion euros last year, China was Germany's most
important trading partner, said Merkel.

"These are impressive figures and we both said we want to extend this," said
Merkel, adding the signing of business agreements pointed to future cooperation
in cars, aviation technology, recycling and artificial intelligence.

GETTY

Merkel and Li Keqiang held talks on issues from trade, civil rights, North Korea
and climate change

Among the deals signed was one between Daimler and joint venture partner BAIC
Motor Corporation on upgrading a Mercedes-Benz factory in Beijing for electric
cars.

Li said he believed they two had found a solution on the issue of Chinese quotas
for electric cars after a lengthy discussion.

However, thorny issues remain between the two exporting nations, with Merkel
saying she had pressed China to open up its market more to German firms who want
a level playing field.

"We need fair market access ... and it's very important to protect intellectual
property and ensure trade and business secrets are kept and of course in times
of cyber possibilities that's not always easy," said Merkel at a business event
later.

Merkel also tackled civil rights, saying she and Li had resolved the issue of
German political foundations working in China which she said were crucial for a
stronger civil society.

"We believe our political foundations make an important contribution and I am
pleased that all our bureaus in China can be registered and hope they can resume
work," she said.

DONALD Trump will today reveal whether he plans to withdraw the US from the
Paris Agreement on climate change. But what is the landmark climate deal?

GETTY

Donald Trump will announce today whether he will pull the United States out of
the Paris Agreement

President Donald Trump said he will be announcing his decision on the
international agreement at the White House at 3pm local time .

Sources have confirmed that Mr Trump plans to pull out the US of the agreement -
a move that is expected to spark outrage across the globe.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr Trump blasted the deal saying it
weakened US industry and pledged to "cancel" it in his first 100 days in office.

But Mr Trump's stance on climate change has angered Tesla CEO Elon Musk and
other high-profile advocates of the Paris deal.

President's daughter Ivanka Trump is believed to have urged her father not to
abandon the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the US should keep
a "seat at the table".

If the US does withdraw, America would join Bashar al-Assad's Syria and
Nicaragua as the only countries which do not support the agreement.

What is the Paris climate agreement?

The Paris Agreement is a historic global pact to cut greenhouse gases and reduce
emissions in the fight against climate change.

The deal was signed by the leaders of about 200 nations and was the first
legally-binding agreement to tackle climate change on a global scale.

The accord came into effect in November 2016 and was hailed as a "historic" step
forward in reducing our carbon footprint.

GETTY

Barack Obama ratified the Paris Agreement with Chinese President Xi JinpingWhat
is the aim of the Paris deal?

The primary goals of the Paris Agreement are:

To hold global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial times - with
the intention of reducing this further to 1.5C.

To cut greenhouses gasses emitted by humans to sustainable levels inline with
the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants, trees and oceans.

Wealthy countries should assist poorer nations by providing a "climate finance"
to help them make the shift to renewable energy sources.

Each country's contribution to cutting emissions will be reviewed and assessed
every five years.

The United States and China ratified the Paris climate agreement together in
September 2016.

Former President of the United States Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi
Jinping submitted their plan to join the agreement at the same time to encourage
other nations to follow their lead.

Senior Obama advisor Brian Deese said at the time: The signal of the two large
emitters taking this step together and taking it early, far earlier than people
had anticipated a year ago, should give confidence to the global communities and
to other countries that are working on their climate change plans, that they too
can move quickly and will be part of a global effort."

HEADLINE: 'BIOLOGICAL ANNIHILATION' as scientists warn sixth mass extinction is
underway

BYLINE: Sean Martin

BODY:

A SIXTH mass extinction is underway with researchers stating that there is a
"biological annihilation" happening of life on Earth.

GETTY

Polar bears face extinction due to the changing climate

Even humans are not safe from the ongoing extinction, researchers have warned,
as the likes of over population and climate change take their toll on life on
Earth.

Prof Gerardo Ceballos, at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, who led
the work, said that the situation has become "so bad" that life on Earth's
prospects look pretty bleak.

The study from the Mexican university shows that 50 per cent of individual
animals have been lost in recent decades, as "powerful assaults" on nature leave
many species, including humans, fighting for their place on the planet.

The research published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences reads: "The resulting biological annihilation obviously will have
serious ecological, economic and social consequences.

disaster  Oceans on edge of being oxygen STARVED due to climate change

GETTY

Humans' impact is almost as

"Humanity will eventually pay a very high price for the decimation of the only
assemblage of life that we know of in the universe."

Previous research has shown that up to 25 per cent of mammals and 13 per cent of
birds will be extinct as humans ravage their food chain and natural habitat,
while hunting and pollution add to the animal's woes.

A paper published in the journal Nature reads: "The ever-increasing and
unprecedented extent and impact of human activities on land and in the oceans
over the past few centuries has dramatically reduced global biodiversity.

"There is overwhelming evidence that habitat loss and fragmentation,
over-exploitation of biological resources, pollution, species invasions and
climate change have increased rates of global species extinctions to levels that
are much higher than those observed in the fossil record."

Another paper added humans have been ruining the planet for other species since
the beginning of their timeline.

It says: "Human-influenced extinctions began when modern humans moved out of
Africa.

GETTY

Snow leopards are at risk due to human intervention

"Successive waves of extinctions in Australia , North America and South America
and Europe were driven largely by a combination of hunting by humans and natural
climate change.

"By 3,000 years ago, Earth had lost half of all terrestrial mammalian megafauna
species and 15 per cent of all bird species."

GETTY

Hunting is contributing to the mass extinction

It added: "Extinction rates for birds, mammals and amphibians are similar at
present to those of the five global mass-extinction events of the past 500
million years that probably resulted from meteorite impacts, massive volcanism
and other cataclysmic forces."

However, all hope is not yet lost providing that humans change their ways.

The paper states: "All species could benefit from the intensification of current
conservation policies, as well as from policies that reduce underlying
anthropogenic threats.

"Developing and enacting such policies, however, will require an unprecedented
degree of engagement between stakeholders, policymakers, natural scientists and
social scientists.

"Earth is capable of providing healthy diets for 10 billion people in 2060 and
preserving viable habitats for the vast majority of its remaining species."

NORTH Korea claims it is "on the brink of war" as a pair of huge US warships
engage in show of force in the region. Here are live updates and the latest
breaking news on North Korea and the US.

America's aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Carl Vinson, is carrying
out a drill with USS Ronald Reagan in the Sea of Japan.

North Korea claims it is on "the brink of war" after the US and South Korea flew
fighter jets close to the hermit kingdom in retaliation for a ballistic missile
test on Monday.

Kim Jong-un warned that North Korea will develop more powerful weapons after its
third missile test in three weeks, according to state-run news agency KCNA.

"He expressed the conviction that it would make a greater leap forward in this
spirit to send a bigger 'gift package' to the Yankees", KCNA quoted Kim as
saying.

1pm Japan's navy and air force have begun a three-day military exercise with USS
Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson in the Sea of Japan.

Japan's Maritime Self Defence Force has sent two ships, including one of its
four helicopter carriers, the Hyuga, to join the US carriers, Japan's military
said.

Japanese Air Self Defence Force F-15s are taking part in simulated combat with
US Navy F-18 fighters at the same time, the military said.

9.40pm: US President Donald Trump discussed North Korea with Vietnamese Prime
Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc at the White House.

Mr Trump sought support for efforts to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear
and missile programmes. Hanoi voiced the same concerns about North Korea.

4.25pm: The US has carried out a successful test of its anti-missile defence
systems, a US defence official has confirmed.

Vice Admiral Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defence Agency, said: "I
was confident before the test that we had the capability to defeat any threat
that they would throw at us.

"And I'm even more confident today after seeing the intercept test yesterday
that we continue to be on that course."

2pm: US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will press for greater cooperation to
contain North Korea's nuclear and missile threat at a regional security forum in
Singapore later this week.

American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Mr
Mattis is likely stress the threat posed by North Korea and its weapons
programmes.

9am: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told China's top diplomat that he would

programmes.

"To resolve this problem peacefully, we would like to work with China, which has
strong influence ," Abe said at the outset of a meeting with Yang Jiechi.

In return, Yang told Abe that he hoped all parties play a constructive role in
resolving the issue.

5am: South Korea's Defence Ministry "intentionally dropped" mentioning that four
more launchers had been deployed for America's THAAD anti-missile system in a
report to President Moon Jae-in's top aides, his office said on Wednesday.

Mr Moon has ordered a probe at the defence ministry, saying it was "very
shocking" the launchers had been brought in without being reported to the new
government or to the public, presidential Blue House spokesman Yoon Young-chan
said.

While the training location is hundreds of miles off the Korean Peninsula, "how
can we say it's not sending a message?" the official said.

The training is only scheduled to last a few days, with the Vinson set to return
to its homeport in the US soon.

3pm: A US supersonic B-1B bomber took part in a joint drill with South Korea on
Monday, according to spokesman for the South Korean defence ministry.

North Korea's state media have the US and South Korea of carrying out a "a

GERMANY has accused Theresa May of being "complicit" in some of Donald Trump's
which they claim is putting Europe's security at risk.

GETTY

Theresa May has talked of her 'sepcial relationship' with Donald Trump

In a damning speech, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel claimed all world leaders
who fail to "determinedly oppose" the US President's stance on climate change,
religion and war are equally accountable.

He roundly condemned Mr Trump's policies, and launched an implicit attack on the
British Prime Minister - who has ignored calls to convince Donald Trump to keep
the US in the Paris Agreement.

And Mr Gabriel made clear there is a growing political divide between the
European Union and America, with the UK hanging on the sidelines.

Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel condemned Trumps policies

Mr Gabriel said: "Whoever accelerates climate change by not protecting the
environment adequately, whoever sells more weapons into war zones, whoever does
not choose to resort to politics to resolve religious conflicts is putting peace
in Europe at risk.

"The Trump administration wants to end climate deals, distribute more arms in
crisis region and prevent people of some religions from traveling into [the US].



"If we Europeans don't determinedly oppose this today, then the flows of
migration into Europe will only become greater.

"Whoever does not oppose these US policies is making themselves complicit."

In contrast Ms May has talked 'special relationship' between the US and UK
stronger.

She has also been accused of being Mr Trump's "mole" in the EU, ahead of the
Brexit negotiations.

Thursday June 1

10pm Mr Trump announced he is pulling the USA out of the landmark Paris
Agreement.

Delivering the announcement in the Rose Garden, he made the much anticipated
statement.

He said the deal "front loads costs on American people", "disadvantages the US"
to benefit other countries and causes a "vastly diminished economic reduction".

The billionaire said: "In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America...
the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord."

8pm President Trump revealed that the US will leave the Paris Agreement today
because he hopes to secure "a better deal" for America.

But he said the US would "begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord
or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.

"So we're getting out but we'll start to negotiate and we'll see if we can make
a deal that's fair."

Mr Trump will say that the Paris Agreement "front loads costs on American
people" and he will "put American workers first".

7.35pm Donald Trump is expected to make his announcement bait the Paris Climate
Agreement at 8pm BST .

The White House has so far remained quiet on what the President's final decision
might be.

"The president has listened to people from all sides and ultimately he's going
to make the best decision for ... the American worker," White House spokeswoman
Sarah Sanders said.

6pm Donald Trump will be the "single leader who caused the most damage to the
planet" if he pulls out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, documentary
filmmaker Jeff Orlowski has said.

2.40pm Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has underlined China's commitment to the Paris
Climate Agreement, in Brussels on Tuesday.

"China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change," Mr Li told
reporters after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The EU and China are prepared to fully commit to the climate change accord,
Chinese officials have confirmed.

2pm The Vatican, which backs the Paris climate change deal, would see a US exit
as a slap in the face and a "disaster for everyone," a senior official said on
Thursday.

"If he really does , it would be a huge slap in the face for us," said Bishop
Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

"It will be a disaster for everyone," he told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica.

1.50pm In a tweet to Donald Trump, European Council President Donald Tusk said:
"Please don't change the climate for the worse."

11.50am Angela Merkel's rival Martin Schulz said that if Donald Trump quits the
agreement, US producers will gain a competitive advantage over their European
rivals.

He said: "If Mr Trump wants to leave the climate pact, then we must talk openly
about trade relations and market distortions."

Former European Parliament President Mr Schulz is standing against Angela Merkel
in the German election later this year.

11am China and the EU will tomorrow issue a joint statement in a bid to save the
international pact against climate change.

All 28 EU states, the European Union and China will back the statement pledging
to full implementation of the Paris Agreement.

10.30am German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed China's commitment to stick
to its climate treaty obligations.

During a joint news conference in Berlin, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang saidL
"China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change."

10am Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "President Putin signed this
convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it,"  told a
conference call with reporters.

"At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this
convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants."

Twitter

9am Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: "Climate change is a
global challenge. No county can place itself outside of this."

8am European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that leaving the
climate deal will be much harder than Donald Trump realises.

Mr Juncker said: "The climate deal says: It takes three, four years after the
treaty took effect last November to exit the agreement.

"That means the idea that you can simply disappear into thin air - that won't
happen. The law is the law, and everyone has to stick to it."

2.05am Donald Trump tweeted: "I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord,
Thursday."

Midnight: Elon Musk said that he has "done all" he can to persuade Donald Trump
to keep the US in the Paris climate deal.

HEADLINE: Snubbed! Furious Juncker vows Brussels will BLOCK trade deals between
US and EU states

BYLINE: Nick Gutteridge, Brussels Correspondent

BODY:

FURIOUS Jean-Claude Juncker last night lashed out at Donald Trump's attempts to
sideline the EU and vowed Brussels would move to block any attempted trade deals
between the US and member states.

GETTY

Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker are at loggerheads over trade

In a rancorous speech the EU Commission chief accused the eurosceptic President
of giving him the "cold shoulder" and ignoring the role of eurocrats in running
European trade negotiations.

Mr Trump has openly stated previously that he prefers dealing bilaterally with
countries on a one to one basis and is not a fan of overbearing supranational
structures like the EU.

Merkel minister desperately tries to play down Trump spat

He reportedly pressed Angela Merkel for a swift trade deal during her trip to
the White House earlier this year, prompting a bemused response from the German
chancellor who replied that all agreements had to go through Brussels.

The billionaire tycoon has also been publicly keen on striking an economic pact
with Britain, which will be able to forge its own trade policy for the first
time in 45 years once it has left the EU.

GETTY

The US President wants to strike trade deals with individual European countries

Talking about Mr Trump's attitude towards Europe, the EU chief said: "They say:
'We do not want to negotiate with you as a European Union but with each member
state separately'.

"We cannot allow individual [trade] agreements between the Americans and
individual European countries to take place."

Mr Juncker made his remarks about the US administration just hours after it
emerged that it is likely to pull America out of the international Paris
Agreement on climate change.

The Brussels boss said he had raised concerns about America's apparent
isolationism during Mr Trump's visit to Brussels last month, but that they fell
on deaf ears.

And now reports have emerged that the EU will seek to realign itself with China
on the issues of trade and climate change after becoming exasperated with the US
President.

Mr Juncker said: "I don't think it's good that there is a picture evolving
where, in the future, we would do more with China than with the United States."

Striking a pessimistic tone, he continued: "That's the wrong direction, I think.
But I cannot prevent this from happening.

"We have explained to Mr Trump that it is not good for the US to withdraw from
international economic life. But he wants to do this. I'm against it, but he
does not care at all."

A vital bi-lateral summit between the EU and China, at which the two are set to
strengthen ties, is taking place in Brussels today with ongoing commitment to
the Paris Agreement expected to be top at the agenda.

HEADLINE: Trump can't quit Paris Agreement until NEXT ELECTION as Juncker says
'you CAN'T exit'

BYLINE: Vickiie Oliphant

BODY:

DONALD Trump may have plans to quit the Paris Agreement on climate change - but
it has been revealed the US may not be able to exit the deal until the day after
its next Presidential election.

The Paris Agreement is seen as the most important global climate agreement ever
signed, with nearly 200 world leaders agreeing to protect the planet.

It is also seen as one of the biggest achievements of Barack Obama's reign as
president.

However, Donald Trump is now set to pull the USA out in a move which will see
America join Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries who do not support the
deal.

A White House source confirmed on Wednesday Mr Trump intends to pull out of the
agreement and the president later tweeted he will announce his decision at 3pm
this afternoon.

But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned President Trump
leaving will be much harder than he realises.

Although President Trump could simply roll back US climate policy, he will still
be tied into the commitment.

Mr Juncker said: "The climate deal says: It takes three, four years after the
treaty took effect last November to exit the agreement.

"That means the idea that you can simply disappear into thin air - that won't
happen.

"The law is the law, and everyone has to stick to it.

"Not everything which is law, and not everything which is written in
international treaties, is fake news. You got to stick to that."

The deal came into force on November 4 last year, and the agreement stipulates
that a withdrawal can legally only be filed after three years - meaning the very
earliest date Mr Trump can quit is November 4, 2019.

Then, following withdrawal, the exit will only legally become effective one year
after that date - on November 4, 2020.

But in a bizarre twist, if Mr Trump did decide to pull out of the deal then the
exit will come the day after the next US Presidential election.

The president had previously dismissed climate change as a hoax and a scam.

In 2012 he tweeted: "The concept of global warming was created by and for the
Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive."

The rumoured exit comes against the advice of Mr Trump's Secretary of State's
Rex Tillerson, who said America should keep a "seat at the table".

The president's daughter Ivanka Trump is also believed to have warned her father
not to pull the county from the agreement.

Hundreds of US companies, including Nike, Starbucks and Mars, also signed a
joint letter warning Mr Trump a withdrawal would threaten "American prosperity".

Trump's repeated threats to quit the Paris Agreement have been met with protests

Mr Trump is believed to be prepared to pull the US out of the agreement - a
decision likely to infuriate global leaders.

At the moment, Syria and Nicaragua are the only countries in the UN that are not
signatories.

The historic agreement, signed by more than 200 world leaders, is designed to
curb the threat of global warming and is widely regarded as one of the biggest
achievements of Barack Obama's presidency.

Political website Axios said two sources "with direct knowledge" of the decision
had confirmed the President's plans to withdraw from the treaty.

Reports in the US claim the Trump administration is split over the decision,
with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson among those who want the US to keep a
"seat at the table".

Speaking at the Federal Association of Employers and the Schwarzkopf Foundation

the deal.

He continued: "I am a transatlantic, but if the American president says in the
next few hours or days he wants to get out of the Paris deal, then it is the
duty of Europe to say this is not the case.

"This is not just about the future of European humanity, it is about the future
of people elsewhere."

The bosses of ExxonMobil Corp , Apple Inc, Dow Chemical Co, Unilever NV and
Tesla Inc were among those urging him to remain in the accord.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, President Trump blasted the accord, and
called global warming a hoax aimed at weakening US industry.

The Republican vowed at the time to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100 days of
becoming president on January 20, part of an effort to bolster US oil and coal
industries.

Robert Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy Corp, an Ohio-based coal company and
major Trump campaign donor, urged President Trump to withdraw from the deal.

At a conference near Los Angeles, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who President Trump
defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said withdrawing would be a mistake.
"Part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good, and that you stand
with your prior administration whether it was of your party or not," she said.

Mr Musk is part of the 18-member Strategic and Policy Forum, a business council.



He is also part of President Trump's manufacturing jobs initiative.

He's met President Trump several times to talk about infrastructure spending,
CNN reported.

HEADLINE: Corbyn's Marxist vision leaves voters seeing red;
Letters

BODY:

STEPHEN Pollard's piece on the nightmare prospect of a minority Labour
government propped up by the SNP ("Left-wing pact to make Corbyn PM would cause
chaos", May 31), makes me wonder what Labour's weak and unpatriotic leader
wouldn't do to make his Marxist dream a reality.

Agree another EU referendum to get the Lib Dem support, cede independence for
Wales and the reunification of Ireland to secure the nationalist vote or agree a
doubling of the UK's £80billlion climate change bill to appease the Greens? But
what about the EU? Would he agree a e100bn bill, uncontrolled immigration and
giving up Gibraltar's sovereignty to leave? In two years time I predict the
letter left by Chancellor John McDonnell to the incoming Conservative Government
would not just say "sorry, there is no money left," but also "there is no Great
Britain either."

HEADLINE: Honour for Dorothy after dedicating life to charity

BODY:

 A retired nurse who has dedicated her life to helping others has been rewarded
for her charitable work.

Dorothy McClements (72) was presented with a national Diamond Award by Christian
Aid for her ongoing dedication to the charity.

She worked at Falkirk Infirmary from 1977 to 2007 and became involved in charity
work at just 15 years old, when she took part in Christian Aid Week collections
with her family in Edinburgh in 1960.

Dorothy, who has two children - Ruth (46) and David (49) - and two
grandchildren, has gone on to take part in the charity's annual Forth Bridge
Cross and has helped in tax and climate change campaigns, taking part in marches
and lobbying politicians.

Dorothy, from Larbert, said: "I was delighted and honoured to be nominated for
this award and thank all the other people involved with me for their support.

"Christian Aid, for me, measures up to all that my faith teaches me about love
in action."

Dorothy, the widow of the Rev. Duncan McClements, is a member of the Grahamston
branch and Falkirk Trinity Church which together help generate over a £1000
annually through their fundraising efforts to help poor communities around the
world.

Christian Aid Week turned 60 and the charity is celebrating the dedication of
its supporters by awarding Diamond Awards across the UK.

The charity thanked Dorothy for her "incredible" efforts.

HEADLINE: Who will get your vote in the 2017 General Election?

BODY:

 Candidates in Falkirk and  Linlithgow and East Falkirk constituencies put their
cases for why they should be elected.

Falkirk

Craig Martin

Labour

The former councillor is now retraining as a chemistry teacher. Married and
living in Falkirk, the 32-year-old has two young sons. He said: "As the only
local candidate from the main political parties you can trust me to be a
champion for Falkirk. Labour are the only party at this election that are
offering hope and a positive vision to create a fairer country for the many, not
the few.

"While the SNP obsesses over how to get another divisive independence
referendum, I believe it is time to get on with the day job. Labour will end the
cuts to budgets, will introduce a £10 an hour minimum wage and will ban zero
hours contracts to ensure families have the security they need.

"Where the SNP simply passes on Tory austerity without putting up a fight,
Labour will transform our economy through investment and development. No more
tax breaks for the richest and big corporations.

"The only way that people across Falkirk can reject this nasty Tory Government
and reject the threat of a divisive second independence referendum is to vote
Craig Martin on June 8 and elect a local champion."

Callum Laidlaw

Conservative

The 33-year-old corporate communications consultant was recently elected
councillor for Portobello Craigmillar. The son of a teacher and small business
owner, he lives in Edinburgh with his partner and two dachshund dogs.

He said: "Falkirk is the only local authority in central Scotland not to benefit
from City Region Deal funding which comes from both the UK and Scottish
Government and is used to invest in infrastructure to attract investment. I
think Falkirk needs to be heard in Westminster and a voice on the Conservative
benches is the best way to achieve this.

"The Conservative Government has committed to a new Industrial Strategy'
targeted at increasing investment in British manufacturing and engineering.
Falkirk has a proud tradition and skilled workforce as well as excellent
connections to the road, rail and air networks. I want to see Falkirk being
heard on the world stage and attracting significant investment to create new
jobs and opportunities, just as the North of England has.

"Like all Conservatives, I am committed to investing in our armed forces and
intelligence services ensuring that we are as protected as we can be in these
uncertain times."

John McNally

SNP

Born in February 1951, John was raised, one of seven children, in his home town
of Denny. His dad, a committed family man, worked in the foundry and was a great
support to his mum in looking after their children.

He said: "I've run a small hairdressing business in Denny for more than 40
years. This has provided me with an insight into how communities live and
interact with each other.

"My wife, a health visitor, and I have been married for 36 years and we have two
grown-up children.

"I've long held a passionate belief in politics and to this day I am deeply
involved in local issues. I worked for my area as a community councillor and
then as an elected councillor. I brought a can do' attitude to represent the
people at Falkirk council for ten years.

"Since then, and thanks to the residents of this area, I was voted in to be your
MP. I have had two years at Westminster and led in important areas including;
defending pension rights for women; standing up for small business; highlighting
the needs of our elderly and disabled; campaigning to reduce childhood obesity
and protecting our wonderful Scottish environment from pollution by microbeads -
and from the threat of fracking.

"Now this snap election has been called it is evermore important for Falkirk to
know that I will continue to be that strong voice rejecting Tory austerity."

Debra Pickering

Green

Originally from Cumbria, Debra has lived in Scotland for 20 years and in Falkirk
for 12 of those with her husband and West Highland Terrier, She has two grown up
daughters and one granddaughter.

A trained psychotherapist with particular interest and experience in the field
of addictions, she has always been interested in politics at both local and
national levels and was one of the youngest ever councillors in Cumbria.

She said her principal motivation in standing was her opposition to fracking,
adding: "I'm tired of the SNP sitting on the fence with the moratorium. Their
outright refusal to ban fracking once and for all is just not good enough for
the people of Falkirk.

"Fracking is dangerous. When the very land we live on, the water we drink and
the air we breathe is at stake we can't stand idly by.

"We need a planned and managed transition away from fossil fuels to sustainable
energy under democratic control which provides energy security, job security and
faces up to the realities of climate change. The Scottish Greens know that
Scotland can meet its needs through a diverse range of sustainable energy
sources.

Austin Reid

Liberal Democrat

The 75-year-old is married and lives in Bo'ness. He believes that the stance of
the Scottish Liberal Democrat party as pro-UK, pro-EU and progressive will be
backed by the people of Falkirk. Austin is convinced that local people rejected
independence by a large margin and should have an MP who can speak for them. He
said: "I want to be a voice for Falkirk and the United Kingdom while
contributing to the development of a tolerant and caring community.

"The Scottish Liberal Democrats have a plan to improve education and invest in
the NHS to support those needing mental health treatment.

"We need an environmental policy which provides a long term future for all of
our communities.

"I will be an effective Member of Parliament as I am experienced at working with
people. I am active in our local community and volunteer with a number of
organisations."

Stuart Martin

UKIP

Despite several attempts to contact Mr Martin and UKIP no details have been
submitted.

Linlithgow and East Falkirk

Joan Coombes

Labour

Having lived in Grangemouth all her life.  Joan is a proud mother to three and a
doting grandmother to two.

She said: "I am not a career politician. I got involved in politics late in life
after I did some volunteering in South America and saw for myself what happens
when governments ignore their people. When I returned back home I wanted to help
my town and was elected a councillor in 2012 and was deputy Leader of Falkirk
Council for the last four years.

"Every election is a choice.  What makes this election different is that the
choice is starker than ever before.  We can choose more of the same: the rich
few getting richer, more children in poverty, our NHS failing and our schools
and social care in crisis.  Or we can vote for change.

"I am proud to stand for the Scottish Labour Party, which is the only party
offering a plan for real change.  A Labour Government would invest in our public
services and our economy paid for through a fair and progressive tax system.

"Lets build a Britain that works for the many, not the few. On June 8 vote Joan
Coombes because Joan cares!"

Martyn Day

SNP

A former councillor in Linlithgow, Martyn said: "Serving as your MP has been an
honour; it is a privilege to be seeking re-election for my home constituency. I
am proud to be standing on my record and that of the SNP. Upon re-election I
will continue to be available to listen to and represent your views.

"I may not always agree with you but I will always ensure that you get a fair
hearing and representation. To support this I have a professionally staffed
office and ensure maximum availability through surgeries, appointments and home
visits.

"The question in this election is which party is capable of preventing the
Tories from doing whatever they want to Scotland. At Westminster, the SNP have
provided the only effective opposition on austerity and attacks on the poor, the
disabled and pensioners.

"Every vote for the SNP is a vote against further cuts to public spending, a
vote to protect the triple lock on pensions, and a vote against any further cuts
to low income working families. A vote for the SNP will also strengthen
Scotland's hand against an extreme Brexit which risks 80,000 Scottish jobs.

The SNP is the only alternative to the Tories for those seeking a stronger,
fairer Scotland."

Charles Kennedy

Conservative

A 62 year old married man with one daughter, Charles was born and raised in West
Calder, has lived in Bathgate for the last 27 years and lived almost all his
life in West Lothian.

Early years education was at West Calder High before going to Napier College to
study quantity surveying. He has spent all of the subsequent 44 years working in
the construction industry as a quantity surveyor.

He said: "Since joining the local Conservative and Unionist Association I have
been active in the constituency, initially arranging campaigns for other
candidates, before standing for council in the Bathgate Ward and then fighting
the 2016 Scottish Election in Linlithgow. In the recent Council election I again
stood in Bathgate and was elected to West Lothian Council.

"During the Scottish Independence Referendum I led the Better Together Group in
West Lothian where we returned a decisive No vote in this area.

"My support for the continuation of the Union of Nations that is our United
Kingdom remains as strong as ever and this General Election provides an
opportunity, through voting Conservative, to turn away the divisive policies of
a Nationalist obsession with Independence and create a strong and stable
Scotland within our United Kingdom."

Sally Pattle

Liberal Democrat

After graduating from St Andrews University in 2000 with a degree in Modern
History and International Relations, Sally (38) enjoyed several careers before
bookselling. These included being an anti-social behaviour officer in
not-so-sunny Plymouth and a stint teaching English at a university in very sunny
Seville, Spain.

In 2012 she studied for a Masters in Publishing at Napier University and went on
to work for Scotland's leading independent publisher, Birlinn Ltd.

In 2015, Sally took over the day-to-day running of Far From The Madding Crowd,
on Linlithgow's High Street. In 2016 she started two book festivals, including a
free schools festival, after realising there were no other similar events
happening in West Lothian.

Sally first joined the Liberal Democrats as a student when Ming Campbell
inspired her at a hustings in 1997. She has been involved in campaigns over the
years, particularly in Plymouth, where she helped out in local council elections
as well as the 2005 general election. After moving back to West Lothian in 2016,
she was instrumental in restarting the West Lothian Liberal Democrat branch. As
convener of the branch, she is responsible for raising awareness of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats and their values and how they relate to local issues.

HEADLINE: Packaging's role in cutting food losses

BYLINE: Paul Gander

BODY:

Alongside its vast array of machinery and materials, last month's Interpack show
in Germany intensified the focus on the human and environmental impacts of food
waste and the vital role that packaging plays in reducing losses post-harvest,
in the supply chain and in the home.


One of the speakers at the Interpack Save Food congress, Johannes Bergmair,
World Packaging Organisation vice president for sustainability and food safety,
pointed to initiatives by organisations including the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation to cut food losses in the developing world.
"But, in countries such as the UK, it's much more to do with losses in
distribution and with the consumer," he told Food Manufacture. "Packaging can
help with design solutions, such as improved portion sizes. Active and
intelligent packaging is a huge issue, along with ways of managing the
atmosphere inside the pack."
Simply ensuring that brand-owners and manufacturers are aware of all of the
technologies and options has to be a major part of the industry's effort, he
said.
"It's to do, too, with consumer awareness of the tremendous scale of this issue,
regarding the amount of energy that is lost, and greenhouse gases (GHG)
produced, by the one-third of our food that is either lost or we throw away," he
said.
Also speaking at Interpack's Save Food event was Helén Williams, senior lecturer
at Karlstad University in Sweden.
"I've been showing how much food waste you would need to avoid in order to
justify, in terms of GHG emissions, using a smaller pack," said Williams. "With
high-climate-impact products such as cheese or meat, you can justify doing
almost anything to the pack."
Even with a relatively low-impact product such as bread, consumers throw away so
much that it is easy to justify, for example, supplying bags half the size and
utilising more packaging materials as a result, she said.
Williams' research has shown that increasing by 60% the amount of plastics
around the same volume of bread would be balanced, in terms of environmental
impact, by saving just one-tenth of a slice of bread.
Over the past two years or so Williams has worked with other partners on a
twin-pack concept for bagged salads in a modified atmosphere, replacing one 65g
pack with two 25g bags and, as a result, using 40% more film. In this case, the
additional environmental impact of the packaging would be balanced by saving
just 3.5g of salad from the bin.
One challenge with the portion-pack approach, she said, was the consumer
perception (often correct) that the retail price of two smaller packs could be
considerably more than the price of one larger pack of the same volume.
"Up to now, the focus in packaging has been so narrow and so much about
materials, materials minimisation and recycling," Williams argued.
"In the future, we need a different agenda, with more collaboration, more
complexity  but also with greater potential for true innovation," she added.
"We need to start talking about packaging-food systems, and not just 'packaging'
in isolation. You can't determine which system is the most sustainable purely by
looking at the material."

HEADLINE: Sustainability goals - Why sustainability cannot be ignored

BODY:

During the 1970s and 1980s, the enormous danger of environmental problems was
increasingly recognised and the principle of sustainable development was
developed. In the following decades, the principle has also been applied to
social and economic areas as well as environmental. The UN 2016 Sustainable
Development Goals state the wider principles of sustainable development:

- to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;

- to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages;

- to achieve universal primary education;

- to promote gender equality; and

- to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable
industrialisation and foster innovation.

It is estimated that $3500bn to $5000bn of investment per year is needed to meet
the goals' investment needs.

The investor perspective

The OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and its due-diligence guidance
provide advice for companies on standards of responsible business conduct. They
are particularly important in countries where domestic policy frameworks remain
weak. Businesses seek to avoid environmental risks that could interrupt
operations. They desire access to raw materials that can be sourced reliably
over the long term. Many of these factors are influenced by location. The
motivation is different, yet sustainable development can still be realised.
Climate change, pollution, dwindling natural resources and economic inequality
are changing societies and economies in such a way that businesses will need to
consider sustainability during the site-selection process. The workforce also
has a growing awareness of sustainable practices. Sustainable investment also
contributes to more direct business factors such as infrastructure spending,
taxation, government and public relations, and potentially even political
stability.

The government perspective

The OECD's policy framework for investment helps governments to put in place
conducive and supportive guidelines for sustainable FDI. Organisations such as
the Private Investment Corporation in the US or Germany's Investment and
Development Corporation have set up sustainable standards for firms they
support. Some trade agreements include principles such as strengthening local
capacities, protection of labour rights and technology transfer, which
contribute to sustainability.

Despite the positive policy frameworks in place, very few investment promotion
agencies (IPAs) and economic development organisations (EDOs) have incorporated
sustainable development into their investment promotion activities. The World
Association of Investment Promotion Agencies conducted a survey of member IPAs
around the world in co-operation with the Columbia Center on Sustainable
Investment. The results showed that economic development is the highest priority
for IPAs, followed by environmental sustainability. Social dimension and
governance are the least prominent factors that IPAs consider in their
investment strategies.

Recommendations for EDOs and IPAs

1. Sustainable investment should become a part of all investment promotion
activities. Sustainability goals should not be 'window dressing' or box-ticking
exercises, but be tangible actions in all phases of investment promotion
activities and eventually be embedded into FDI targets, aftercare and policy
advocacy activities. The sector strategy for inward investment should
incorporate sustainable development through:

- identifying sectors where FDI can have a direct impact on sustainable
development, such as renewable energy investment projects, eco-tourism and
organic agriculture;

- identifying sectors where FDI can play an indirect role, especially through
technology transfer and specialist services and products that address key
sustainable development issues; and

- targeting types of projects within all target sectors that minimise threats
caused by pollution, natural resource depletion, intensive agriculture and urban
sprawl.

Investor targeting and lead-generation activities should focus on companies that
can support sustainable development and growth. Target companies will comprise
not only the major multinational enterprises but also smaller specialist
companies. The process may also include targeting non-profit organisations and
associations who have the expertise and commitment to support sustainable
development.

IPAs and EDOs need to consider the type of FDI facilitation services they can
offer small companies and non-profit organisations, which may have a high
proportion of non-equity mode investments, such as technology transfer
agreements.

In the most practical terms, to implement a sustainable FDI programme will
require identifying companies that will contribute to sustainable development
and targeting these companies to invest in the location.

2. Incentives policies should be aligned with achieving sustainable investment.

If sustainable development is to be an end goal for FDI, business attraction and
economic development, the traditional investor attraction tools need to adapt to
encourage sustainable investment. Economic development incentives - tax credits,
grants, training programmes, capital investment funds, low-cost loans,
infrastructure grants and the like - have been used for decades with the aim of
encouraging investment decisions to go to one location or another. Incentives
have rightly come under scrutiny for overuse and misuse. As with any tools, they
are only effective for the purpose for which they have been designed.
Nonetheless, credits and grants can play an important role in encouraging or
enabling sustainable investments. While most investment incentives have
typically been designed to achieve capital investment and job creation
objectives, some have been put in place successfully to encourage sustainable
development practices. Instead of being used to draw investment away from
competitive regions or to areas with economic hardship, these programmes have
been instead designed to encourage spending on energy and water conservation
measures, local cogeneration and renewable energy, and even to promote workforce
use of public or alternative transportation. The activities most commonly
incentivised now focus on energy, recycling and other aspect of environmental
sustainability. These are easily measured and include:

- installing pollution control equipment;

- investing in energy-efficient buildings or components;

- manufacturing products from recycled materials;

- investing in systems to capture items from a company's waste stream for
recycling or use by others;

- undertaking environmental remediation activities;

- adapting manufacturing or other processes to use alternate energy sources such
as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass; and - producing alternative fuels for
vehicles or using alternative fuels to power a company's own fleet.

3. Free zone development should be aligned with achieving sustainable
investment.

Many governments have used free zones as an incentive instrument to attract
investment to alleviate poverty and achieve substantial economic development.
Free zones have successfully tapped into a large pool of multinationals looking
to relocate parts of their global value chains to locations with competitive
advantages such as preferential market access, generous incentive packages and
low-cost labour. However, several developments have eroded the sources of
competitiveness of these traditional free zones since the beginning of this
century, including the proliferation of trade agreements and international
agreements on incentives reducing the relative benefits of zones; fierce
competition putting pressure on labour costs and working standards in some free
zones; and stagnant growth in FDI which has led to an oversupply of zone space.
Free zones must move away from tax and cost advantages and lowering standards to
remain competitive. They should rather look to maximise 'dynamic' benefits such
as economic diversification, skills development, entrepreneurialism, poverty
alleviation and policy reform by shifting to alternative and sustainable sources
of competitiveness. Such a shift should be aligned with so-called 'new
generation' investment policies. These put a high priority on inclusive growth
and sustainable development while strengthening or maintaining the
competitiveness of the investment climate. Standards and practices related to
sustainable development promoted in such free zones typically include:

- ensuring standards for working hours and benefits;

- giving unions the right to operate in the zone;

- promoting equality;

- reducing emissions by using renewable energy sources, or improved energy
efficiency;

- reducing waste;

- protecting the environment with waste disposal;

- ensuring the protection of employee health;

- introducing and monitoring work safety rules;

- introducing and enforcing anti-corruption standards; and

- improving (backward) linkages.

Consequently, free zones may develop as centres of sustainable development in
line with international socio-environmental standards and contribute to
realising environmental and social policy objectives.

HEADLINE: Free zones - Q&A: Mohammed Al Zarooni - A certain attraction

BODY:

Q The global investment environment is challenging at the moment with political
uncertainties in many key markets. How is this affecting free zones? And how
should they respond?

A We agree these uncertainties are a challenge for free zones but free zones can
convert these challenges into opportunity. In fact, free zones can become more
attractive in these environments, and contribute to the move from uncertainty to
certainty. While free zones cannot stay completely insulated from such
uncertainties, they are less insecure and [these uncertainties] are likely to
impact free zones less severely given that free zones are often special enclaves
and generally enjoy governments' policy support and fiscal support. Moreover,
free zones have the ability to convert these challenges into opportunities. In
fact, by attracting investments, free zones' impact on economic development is
significant and thereby contributes to moving from uncertainty to certainty.

Q What other major global trends do you see impacting free zones currently? A
Technology will certainly top the list of growth areas of the future. It is
technological innovation and technology adoption that will drive future growth
of most kinds of businesses. Through innovation, ways of doing business are
changing rapidly and becoming more transparent. The border between the free zone
and the host economy is changing; technology is removing it. So, for
governments, it would make sense to establish free zones that promote
tech-intensive activities that will benefit the largest number of people. This
requires thinking beyond incentives. The other major trend impacting free zones
is in the area of clean energy. Clean energy clusters can play a significant
role to ensure energy security and stability and at the same time reduce the
adverse effects of climate change, especially in tropical regions that are more
vulnerable to the consequences of global warming. Governments would do well to
establish free zones and clusters that research ways and means to address the
climate issue from a long-term perspective. Green Zone certifications that we
offer through our Free Zones of the Future programme help encourage and support
these efforts.

Q Free zones are at many different stages of development. What can emerging
zones learn from their more developed peers?

A Free zones are a part of the global value chain and are susceptible to changes
in the global growth pattern. Because change is the only constant, emerging free
zones have to be on a constant quest to innovate, stay relevant and
strategically shift gears to meet future needs. This comes through networking
and the transfer of knowledge between zones at differing levels of development.
Technology adoption is surely one that the emerging free zones can learn from
the well-developed zones. Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly critical.
For developed zones it is a case of 'learn from me but don't copy me'. You have
to tailor what you learn to suit your unique needs. Sustainability is another
paradigm. Apart from traditional financial incentives, emerging free zones need
to learn and adapt to fewer forms of incentives to attract as well as retain
incentives.

HEADLINE: Leaving Paris accord 'will harm US job growth'

BODY:

US companies have expressed their opposition to president Donald Trump's
decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Corporate giants Apple,
Facebook, Google and Microsoft, among others, have argued that the Paris
agreement generates jobs and growth, opening the market for more innovative and
green technologies. David MacLennan, CEO of global agricultural company Cargill,
said the withdrawal would "negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state
of our environment and relationships among the world community". Even energy
giants ExxonMobil and General Electric previously tried to convince the
president to remain in the accord. There is not expected to be much impact on
the US's economy overall in the near term. However, many fear that withdrawal
will limit US access to new markets and investment in renewables may be hit.

HEADLINE: France strikes back

BODY:

The landslide election of centrist pro-EU Emmanuel Macron in May buoyed the euro
and allowed markets to breathe a sigh of relief that France's most unpredictable
election in modern memory was over. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen was
soundly defeated, and 39-year-old former investment banker Mr Macron, leader of
the nascent La RApublique en Marche (LREM) party, was swept into the AlysAe
Palace on the promise of a stronger EU, labour reforms and a commitment to
globalism. "In France, we have sensed among our clients a real enthusiasm about
the election of Mr Macron," says Carol Santoni, partner at business law firm
Racine in Paris. "He is perceived by overseas investors, private equity funds
and fund managers as a sign of genuine hope regarding the expected economic
growth, the implementation of necessary reforms in France and a pro- Europe
attitude." Mr Macron's first weeks have been broadly deemed a success.

Voters seem impressed by his performance in the diplomatic arena, from a frank
conversation with Russian premier Vladimir Putin to an unusually long but
assertive handshake with US president Donald Trump that garnered much attention
on the internet. But the real work lies ahead, as the new president's most
ambitious election pledges - labour and business reform - run the gauntlet of
the French union system. Much of his success will depend on whether LREM can
achieve a majority in France's National Assembly following parliamentary
elections in mid-June.

Union issues France is renowned for its labour strikes; the right to strike is
enshrined in the country's constitution, and unions have the power to paralyse
parts of the economy. In May of 2016, the former government of FranAois Hollande
introduced labour reforms involving the extension of the 35-hour working week to
46 hours and giving employers more freedom to lay off workers. Unions, which saw
this as an affront to workers' rights, responded by striking for several months
- litter mounted in the streets, trains and planes were cancelled, and petrol
stations ran dry. Air France and oil multinational Total each lost more than
$45m between the months of May and June, and Total's CEO threatened to
reconsider the company's investments in France. "France has had an abnormally
high level of unemployment for decades, which can be explained in part by its
labour laws," says Charles Fabry, partner at the Paris office of law firm Squire
Patton Boggs. Unemployment has hovered around the 10% mark since 2013, and
nearly one in four young people are unemployed. Strict worker protections, high
employer costs and heavy red tape deter many employers from hiring. "While
France's lagging performance can be explained by many different factors, it has
become increasingly clear that the rigidities of the French labour market have
prevented unemployment from falling despite a noticeable recovery in the
eurozone," says Mujtaba Rahman, Europe managing director at Eurasia Group, a
political risk consultancy.

A mixed landscape

Well aware of this challenge, the president does not appear to be wasting time.
His centre-right prime minister Adouard Philippe recently announced the
government will be holding "intense consultations" throughout the summer with
the labour unions. "The unions don't seem to be reacting too badly for the
moment, but no one knows how it will turn out," says Mr Fabry. "Mr Macron will
probably adapt his reforms to what he perceives to be the appropriate course
given his current contacts." On the unions' individual stances, Mr Fabry says:
"They're divided. The number one union, the French Democratic Confederation of
Labour, is quite positive. The others, not so much. It's a mixed landscape for
the moment." "Mr Macron intends to turn the logic of French labour markets on
its head, prioritising company-based agreements over norms negotiated within
sectors and the rules defined by law," says Mr Rahman. The president also aims
to promote investment in technology and attract more foreign companies, often a
challenge due to France's taxation rate being among the highest in the world.
Reform struggles

While Mr Macron's power to implement policy depends heavily on the outcome of
the parliamentary elections, "he is planning reforms to liberalise the labour
market, decentralise collective bargaining and bring in a Nordic-style
'flexicurity' welfare model", says Emily Mansfield, an analyst at the Economist
Intelligence Unit. "He's announced plans to cut the corporate tax rate from
33.3% to 25%, with further tax breaks for small businesses, and incentives to
encourage job creation." But, she warns: "He is likely to face resistance both
in parliament and on the streets." "Getting labour reforms through in France is
never easy, but the strongest union in the private sector is moderate and union
reaction may prove less of an obstacle than in the past," says Michael Sippit,
chairman at law firm Clarkslegal. "As the UK has learned long ago, serious
economic improvement generally needs a limit on the disruptive power of trade
unions, while preserving their role and voice in shaping policy as far as
possible." Reforms may also focus on how to exploit Brexit by taking business
from London in the financial sector, Mr Sippit adds - and this has historically
been hindered, of course, by France's rigid regulations. Meanwhile, taking a
hard stance during Brexit negotiations is to be expected, says Ms Mansfield.
"This is just in line with the French establishment, which takes the view that
non-membership of the EU must necessarily be inferior to membership. Although it
is not in France's long-term economic interests to come down too hard on the UK,
the immediate political context requires a firm approach in order to quell the
rise of euroscepticism in France and across Europe."

Cross-section of society

As it stands, pollsters are projecting a potential absolute majority for the
LREM in the National Assembly off the back of Mr Macron's early popularity.
Eurasia Group gives it a 70% probability, adding that moderate voters have been
impressed by the appointment of a well-balanced cabinet - independent from
traditional parties, LREM consists of a fairly even spread of figures from the
left, the right and civil society. Meanwhile, the president must still convince
those who voted against him that his vision is in their interests. "What the
election has shown is that French politics is now divided between the people who
benefit from globalisation and the people who don't," says Mr Fabry. "There is
one result he must achieve: unemployment decreasing." The past few months have
seen unemployment fall below 10% for the first time in a few years, and while
not of Mr Macron's doing, it certainly makes his job easier. FDI inflows have
also increased from $15bn in 2014 to $46bn in 2016, according to figures from
Unctad. Mr Macron appears to have the wind at his back, but the road ahead will
test both his resolve and his ability to navigate France's complex political
landscape. After fixing the French economy, he can look forward to dealing with
eurozone reform, Donald Trump, Russia, global terrorism and climate change.
After all, there is no striking for the president.

HEADLINE: comment



HIGHLIGHT: Brian MaddersonPRA chairman

 BODY:

As I write this, if the pollsters are correct, the 'blues' will continue to form
the government. Mrs May has run her campaign on the mantra of 'strong and
stable' leadership but, when back in office, will she take the opportunity to
change her Cabinet? We have already had rapid personnel changes over recent
years and there have even been changes to entire departments with the Department
for Energy & Climate Change (DECC) being subsumed into the revamped Department
for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) only last year.


Whatever the final outcome, key trade associations such as the Petrol Retailers
Association (PRA) will have to be ready to lobby on important issues with new
political appointees. The pace of change is quickening with alternative fuels
and technology improvements rapidly impacting the forecourt sector. Our work
representing independent forecourt retailers across the UK has never been more
important.
Perhaps the renewed focus on clean air in our cities and the concomitant push
towards Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) will overtake proposals to try and
increase the biofuel content of existing fuels.
But more worrying has been the 'demonisation' of diesel. We are now faced with
the prospect of up to 15 cities in the UK being given licence to start
penalising diesel vehicles through higher entry charges and higher parking
charges. Central government may try to stay in the background so that these
Local Authorities take the flak from motorists and delivery firms. However,
without firm guidelines there could be a confusing and chaotic range of charges
being levied across the UK.
Another proposal to tackle pollution from older diesel cars is for a scrappage
scheme. However, any such scheme needs to be well thought through if it is to be
effective. Do not rule out a move by HM Treasury to increase diesel duty by,
say, 2ppl to pay for the scheme. PRA and our policy advisers are preparing a
submission to the recently launched Consultation on Air Quality Plan.
Additionally we are working with other trade associations to forestall such a
move and to try and lower fuel duty on economic grounds.

HEADLINE: Lib Dem candidate appeals to voters in Dumfries and Galloway

BODY:

 Joan Mitchell from Carsluith is standing at next week's Gemeral Election for
the Dumfries and Galloway seat.

As her campaign for election to Westminster entered it's final week, the
Scottish Liberal Democrat candidate said: "For every young person, parent or
grandparent, the priority for Galloway at this election must be to look to the
future and give our young people the best chance in life.

"This means achieving an open, tolerant, fair society, rejecting the divisions
of the past. It means reasserting the importance of international cooperation to
tackle big issues like poverty, conflict, terrorism and climate change.  No
country can tackle these on its own and we must resist both Scottish
nationalism, which would pull us out of the United Kingdom, and Teresa May's
extreme Brexit, which would take us out of the Single European Market,
struggling to establish a positive relationship with our European neighbours.

"Leaving the World's biggest home market will not help us build a thriving
economy with job opportunities for young people.  It will not help us pay for
the public services like education vital to their success. It will not help us
pay for the investment in infrastructure needed in rural areas.

"The voice of young people must be heard.  Across the UK only 28% of 18-25 year
olds voted to leave the EU. Liberal Democrats would extend the vote to 16 and 17
year olds - it is their future which is being decided.

"The Liberal Democrats are the only party which clearly supports both the United
Kingdom and retaining as close a relationship with Europe as possible. It is the
only Party committed to offering the British people the final say once Brexit
terms are known.  Every vote for Liberal Democrats reinforces that positive
message.

"Over a number of years I have sought to represent the interests of my home area
of Galloway at all levels. That has ranged from standing up for the Mid Galloway
area in the Council in Dumfries, working with various organisations at a
national level on issues relating to the environment and the local economy and
highlighting the many positive initiatives taking place locally with colleagues
in other regions of Europe. I hope you will consider giving me your vote at this
election."

HEADLINE: Reading general election candidates debate issues at hustings event;
Candidates, minus the Tories,  debated a range of issues at the event

BYLINE: By Hugh Fort

BODY:

Reading's political hopefuls put their messages across in a "reverse hustings"
where the debate was set by the audience.

The event was held at the Quaker Meeting House in Church Street,Reading, on
Wednesday, May 31

The event featuredLabour's Reading East candidate Matt Rodda andReading
Westcandidate Olivia Bailey, representatives fromThe Liberal Democrats,Reading
Eastindependent candidate Michael Jeffrey Turberville and Andy Kirkwood of the
Movement for Active Democracy also Reading East.

Kizzi Johannessen of theGreen Partywas due to take part but was taken ill on the
night, so the party's representative for both wards was Reading West candidate
Jamie Whitham.

General Election 2017: Reading Tories snub hustings invitation

TorycandidatesRob WilsonandAlok Sharmadeclinedto appear at the event.

The idea of the event was to allow members of the audience to ask questions on
four pre-determined subjects.

After those questions were asked, each candidate was then given a short period
of time to give their answers to as many of the questions asked as they could.

The topics were homelessness and housing, integration and isolation in the
community, energy and the environment and creating a fairer society.

Subjects include how to deal with street homelessness, the lack of affordable
housing, high rents and the drawing power of the south-east compared to other
areas.

Ms Bailey said: "This is a huge problem, Labour's manifesto is really clear on
this.

"We will build a million homes, half of which are affordable.

Mr Whitham said the Green Party would end the Right to Buy scheme, introduce a
"living rent" as well as more zero carbon homes and "abolish the bedroom tax" as
part of its housing strategy.

Debate on this subject included protecting "friends, family and colleagues"
affected byBrexitand cuts to public services aimed at helping people learn
English.

Mr Whitham said the party demanded the final terms of Brexit to be scrutinised,
guaranteeing foreigners living in this country protection, as well as remaining
in the single market.

Ms Bailey said she felt "our country has been significantly better by the
contribution of migrants from Europe and from around the world."

All you need to know about the General Election 2017

She continued: "The Labour Party is very clear we'd guarantee and protect the
rights of EU migrants living in the UK.

"I think it's disgraceful Theresa May has not done that.

"We must take as many refugees as we can as a country, and I think it's a
disgrace that the Tories have already stopped the Dubs scheme for child refugees
- a handful of children here without their parents."

Liberal Democrat representative James Moore, said: "On Brexit, the Lib Dems
don't think leaving the single market is inevitable.

"We also support the Dubs scheme and think it's a travesty the Tories have ended
it.

"In terms of English skills, you've got to invest in that.

"There are so many multicultural families across Reading."

The audience asked questions on subjects including climate change, transport and
pollution and the controversial third runway at Heathrow.

Independent candidate Mr Turberville spoke of the need for far more high speed
rail networks.

His vision is for the country to have one airport served by a network of train
lines which people could access from anywhere in the country.

He said the project meant people would be able to reach the airport from
anywhere within a maximum of two-and-a-half hours, which would reduce the
pollution caused by air travel.

Mr Rodda said the issue of the environment was "the best example of the very
serious choice between the main parties".

He said: "We have the ability to stop climate change or we can let it roll
forward with its inevitable, awful consequences for future generations."

He also spoke of Labour's support for high speed rail and electrification of
train lines, even though it's "not easy and not popular".

Mr Kirkwood said he was "staggered by the apathy and lethargy" of governments.

He added he was "not a fan" of nuclear or fracking.

He said government would not make the changes needed as they were "driven by
banks and under secretaries".

General Election 2017

Votes for 16 year olds, children's mental health and schools funding all
featured heavily in this discussion.

Mr Kirkwood said: "The system we have does not work, it is controlled by the
banks and corporations, until we realise this nothing will change.

"If we were continuously voting on the subjects discussed tonight, all those
things would change tomorrow."

Mr Turberville said he supported voting at 16 and said zero hours contracts
"shouldn't exist".

Reading

Lib Dem Mr Moore said the party supported votes at 16 and would introduce a
proportional representation system of voting.

He said, "no grammar schools thank you" and pledged to keep free school meals.

He added more would be spent on improving children's mental health under a Lib
Dem government and said the party would introduce a better living wage as well
as "stamp out" zero hours contracts.

Mr Rodda lamented the absence of the Tories at the debate as no one could grill
them on their policies.

He spoke of the discrepancy of life expectancy in different parts of Reading.

General Election 2017: What are the key issues in your constituency and who's
standing?

He said: "It's time to end austerity - it's not worked.

"We need to restart our economy, invest in infrastructure and put money back
into key services.

"We do need to ask the very well-off and the corporations to pay a bit more
tax."

He added Labour would stop the "grossly unfair" practice of zero hours
contracts.

of policies

Mr Whitham said the party would introduce proportional representation and votes
at 16, take action to tackle racism and discrimination, and offer free universal
care for children.

He also said the party would abolish the Ofsted schools inspection system and
zero hours contracts.

HEADLINE: Six Largest Pensions Systems To Have USD224Tn Gap By 2050

BODY:

The world's six largest pension systems will have a joint shortfall of USD224
trillion by 2050, which is "setting the industrialized world up for biggest
pension crisis in history." This is the conclusion of a white paper released by
the World Economic Forum, entitled We'll Live to 100 "" How Can We Afford It?

The report calculates the impact of ageing populations on the pension gap in the
world's largest pension markets, which include the US, UK, Japan, Netherlands,
Canada and Australia. The gap in those markets is the largest in the US, where a
current shortfall of USD28 trillion is projected to rise to USD137 trillion in
2050.

Adding China and India, which have the world's largest populations, the combined
savings gap for the eight countries reaches a total of more than USD400 trillion
by 2050, a sum five times the size of the current global economy, the study
disclosed.

"The anticipated increase in longevity and resulting ageing populations is the
financial equivalent of climate change," said Michael Drexler, head of financial
and infrastructure systems at the World Economic Forum, in a statement.

"The retirement savings challenge is at crisis point and the time to act is
now," argued Jacques Goulet, president, health and wealth at Mercer, and project
partner in the report. "There is no one "~silver bullet' solution to solve the
retirement gap. Individuals need to increase their personal savings and
financial literacy, while the private sector and governments should provide
programmes to support them," he added.

NEST Case Study Supporting the report is a Retirement Handbook, where the World
Economic Forum details 12 "examples of pension reforms and approaches enacted to
address the challenges that retirement systems face."

The creation of the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) in the UK, a
defined contribution (DC) pension scheme set up by the government in 2008 to
facilitate auto-enrolment, is one of these case studies. "NEST's in-house team
took existing and well-understood ways of managing money, and combined them to
create a new approach to long-term saving for UK workers," the document stated.

NEST's investment strategy, in the hands of CIO Mark Fawcett, is also praised in
the handbook. "Underlying the customer proposition, however, is a sophisticated
investment strategy that adjusts the risk/return profile in stages." This
approach limits "volatility and the impact this can have on the attitude of
financially inexperienced savers towards saving for retirement, while at the
same time achieving sufficient growth to contribute meaningfully towards
retirement income," the document added.

HEADLINE: Buffer Scheme Commits USD50Mn To New PE Fund

BODY:

AP-Fonden 2 (AP2), one of the six Swedish buffer funds with assets worth
SEK324.5 billion (USD37.2 billion), has invested USD50 million in The Rise Fund.
The vehicle, a new private equity fund managed by California-based manager TPG
Growth, aligns its investments with the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG)""17 targets adopted at the UN's Sustainable Development
Summit in September 2015 to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and
tackle climate change by 2030.

"We think it is a good investment for us, both when it comes to financial
returns but also because the fund is committed to achieving positive social and
environmental outcomes," Eva Halvarsson, AP2's ceo, told iiSEARCHES. The move
will be funded by the scheme's current available assets as it continues to
consider private equity investments.

The fund, with a global spectrum, will invest in companies in seven sectors:
education, energy, food and agriculture, financial services, growth
infrastructure, healthcare, and technology, media and telecommunications. "The
interesting thing is that we are expecting a measurement of how the investments
are affecting the SDGs," Halvarsson explained. TPG Growth is working with a
non-profit strategic advisor, The Bridgespan Group, to provide this data. "Our
expectations are high," she noted.

More PE Investments AP2, similarly to other AP Funds, has a 5% limit from the
Swedish government on its private equity investments (iiSEARCHES, 24/8). "We are
very close to the 5%, [but] we want to use our mandate as much as we can,"
Halvarsson stated.

At the moment, AP2 has "enough room for [private equity investments] this year,"
Halvarsson argued, without disclosing the available amount. "It depends on the
size of our total assets and on how the dollar is moving," she explained.

"It is important for us to have a continuous allocation, but we can manage this
by selling [stakes] in the secondary market. We can also hope for the government
to change our investment regulation," Halvarsson said. The country's government
has recently launched a reform of the funds' investment rules, which could
result in new caps for the buffer schemes (iiSEARCHES, 2/6).

HEADLINE: Trump's Paris Exit Leaves Investors Questioning US Green Position

BODY:

Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement""in which
governments around the world commit to keeping the global average temperature to
below 2°C""is making investors question "if the US should be a natural step for
infrastructure and renewable energy investments." This is the opinion of Pelle
Pedersen, head of responsible investment at Pensionskassernes Administration
(PKA), a DKK250 billion (GBP29.6 billion) pension company that handles three
health and social work schemes in Hellerup.

"We have invested heavily into offshore wind parks in Northern Europe""Denmark,
Germany, Holland and the UK""and we see similar developments taking place in the
US," Pedersen told iiSEARCHES. "But of course considering what is taking place,
we will need to see if governors at a state level are supporting this
transition," he noted.

After Trump's announcement, at the beginning of the month, several US
states""such as California, New York and Washington""have declared that they
will continue to back the accord. Also, the process of withdrawing the country
from the Paris Agreement cannot be made quickly and the earliest the US can
formally leave is Nov. 4, 2020""just a couple of days after the next
presidential election.

"Many investors, including PKA, are agnostics""so we go where the interesting
projects are," Pedersen said. The company, which has a set goal to invest 10% of
its portfolio in climate-friendly assets by 2020 (iiSEARCHES, 25/11/15), already
has several investments in the US""private equity and infrastructure""which it
will keep.

Georgina Laird, sustainable investment analyst at Kames Capital, an
Edinburgh-based manager with total assets worth GBP45.3 billion, believes "that
it is too late to slow the adoption of environmentally-friendly technologies,"
she said in a statement.

"From solar power, to wind power to electric vehicles, momentum has been
building for some time. Barriers for adoption have been falling and returns on
investment improving, to the point where subsidies are largely no longer
necessary," Laird noted in the release.

Laird argued that the impact of Trump's decision "will be extremely marginal,"
with the firm not expecting any negative repercussions for any of its underlying
investments due to this US policy change.

Europe Needs To Take Charge Pedersen believes that Europe needs to show "even
stronger leadership and commit to ambitious climate targets" after Trump's move.
"We have emphasised to the European Commission (EC) and to the European
Parliament that they need to provide a stable political framework, and commit to
binding ambitious targets, because that allows investors to plan ahead""it is
all about a stable political framework," he noted.

"I am surprised to see that so many policymakers within the [European Union] EU
are scared of strong commitments to binding targets, because they fear they will
not be able to achieve" these goals, Pedersen stressed. This is
counterproductive, he argued, because if no targets are set "investors will be
cautious about investing."

Pedersen was last week in Brussels, where he engaged with different members of
the European Parliament, and made presentations to representatives of the EC,
which are currently discussing a proposal for a review of the Energy Efficiency
Directive (EED). Among other goals, this new legislation sets as target a 30%
reduction in energy consumption by 2030, when compared with 2007.

"We explained why the current negotiations on energy efficiency are so
important," Pedersen said. "This is an untapped market, because it is very
difficult to a lot of investors to invest in energy efficiency, it is a lot
easier to invest in an offshore wind park," for example, he argued. There are no
"financial products out there, besides green bonds, to invest in energy
efficiency," he concluded.

HEADLINE: Investors Work On Report For Oil, Gas Engagement

BODY:

A group of four European institutional investors have promoted a new report
looking at how much capital of oil and gas companies will be at risk in a 2°C
degree world, which will be used for engagement with these firms. According to
this research, some USD2.3 trillion of projects""roughly a third of business as
usual investment until 2025""is inconsistent with the objectives to limit
climate change to a maximum of 2°C degrees.

The research, entitled 2 Degrees of Separation: Transition Risk for Oil & Gas in
a Low Carbon World, was produced by Carbon Tracker and Principles for
Responsible Investment (PRI), in collaboration with Dutch PGGM, Danish
Pensionskassernes Administration (PKA), French Fonds de Reserve pour les
Retraites (FRR), Swedish AP-Fonden 7 (AP7), and British manager Legal & General
Investment Management.

"Investors need data to be able to quantify how much capital these companies
could be wasting ["¦].This report will work for many investors as an engagement
tool in order to explain why they [oil and gas companies] should be diversifying
their portfolios and taking climate change seriously," Pelle Pedersen, PKA's
head of responsible investment, told iiSEARCHES.

The report shows that five of the world's six largest listed oil companies risk
wasting more than 30% of possible spending on upstream projects. Exxon is more
exposed to the energy transition than any other oil and gas major with 40-50% of
capex allocated to uneconomic projects. Shell, Chevron, Total and Eni all have
around average exposure, risking 30-40% of spending.

In some cases in the US, this exposure goes up to 60-70%, such as Southwestern
Energy and Apache. "We were not really surprised to see that many of the
North-American companies have much more capital at risk versus some of the
European companies, but when you have 50% or 70% [of capital at risk] in some
cases, that is quite surprising," Pedersen noted. "If they continue with
business as usual, that is where we could end up," he warned. Even with European
companies, such as BP and Shell, which "have taken steps to diversify their
portfolio, much more could be done," he stressed.

PKA's Engagement With DKK250 billion (USD37.4 billion) in assets, PKA has
roughly DKK900 million invested in oil and gas companies. "We are still very
underweighted in the energy sector," Pedersen said.

The pensions company, which handles three health and social work schemes in
Hellerup, will use this report to set up its investment strategy. "We will be
engaging with the companies of this list that we still have in our portfolio. We
have divested from some of these already," Pedersen said. In April, PKA
announced that it had divested from six Canadian tar sands companies due to
climate risk, and initiated a dialogue with 44 other firms in the oil and gas
sector (iiSEARCHES, 20/4).

"That engagement will pan over the next nine, 12 months, and then we will assess
if we need to take new steps to mitigate climate change risk," Pedersen noted,
adding that divestment will be the last resort option.

Borrower's comment:

This is the longest dated green benchmark ever. It's important because it
highlights the dimension of long term sustainable investment, which is a core
component of Capital Markets Union (CMU). The European Commission would like to
mainstream sustainability in the broader policy framework. Once again we've
offered a product that lives up to the goals of our longer term policy
perspective as the Bank of the European Union.

The timing was important. We ensured the payment date matched that of our
inaugural issue 10 years ago, so it was a symbolic project. It follows the
European Council's reaffirmation last week of the EU's commitment to the Paris
Agreement. We're also holding several commemorative events for the first issue
back in 2007. We hired the original leads and payment agent from that deal for
this purpose and the new trade.

The deal did not come out of the blue. It was planned to combine good timing
from a capital markets perspective "" because Wednesday was a good day to issue
"" but also the longer term strategy.

We had quite a few investors in the bond that had not participated in our
previous Climate Awareness Bonds (CABs). This week was a good time to come
because there was limited issuance from our peers, our lack of deals over the
last few weeks boosted our rarity value, swap rates and spreads were steady to
the average levels of the last few months and the market was reassured by the
rescue of some Italian banks. Additionally, rates moved up 15bp compared to
Tuesday, so we could offer a yield of above 1.5%.

We also wanted to price in line with our secondary conventional Ecoop curve.
Since we've seen that our green curve has tended to outperform conventional
Ecoops in secondary, this provided a premium versus the extrapolated fair value.

We stated our target size at â,¬500m because that's the size we've used in the
past to open new Ecoops. But as we had very good quality in the book we could
print â,¬1bn, despite some orders having limits and us tightening by 1bp,
validating our pricing rationale.


Bookrunners' comment:

It was the longest dated green bond ever from a supranational or agency, and
tops the EIB's own 2037 CAB for length.

There were a good variety of accounts including some very dedicated green
accounts. We clearly saw also some very nice interest from more normal players
in this part of the curve that don't have dedicated green funds. But the largest
orders were dedicated green funds.

On Thursday the bond was pretty stable to a touch tighter, now at 4.5bp versus
mid-swaps.

It's very important to underline that CABs outperform Eurocooperation bonds
(Ecoops) on secondary. It's not obvious at first glance, but when you look into
where CABs are trading versus the on-the-runs in the neighbouring maturities,
you easily find CABs trading roughly 3bp through. This is a development that the
community has been talking about for so long and EIB has proven that it clearly
is possible to have green bonds in the SSA market that offer a funding
advantage. This trade came essentially flat to the normal curve, and was still
able to garner demand in excess of â,¬1.2bn. Investors are increasingly
realising that there is a slight pricing differential and are willing to put
money to work that is flat to the normal curve but with a premium to the green
curve.

It's not a one-off "" it's a very, very gradual development that's not true for
every issuer and every bond. But given the good green bond quality of EIB ""
they have assurance from KPMG which is another layer and is something that
offers a little bit more than the typical second opinion.

Given this was issued on the 10th anniversary of the first green bond, you can
see the process of having green bonds tighter than normal bonds really took a
long time. Will hopefully see a little more of this across the board, but it's
good to see one issuer proving it's possible.

Market appraisal:

""¦a â,¬1bn 30 year is always a very good result. A very solid trade that is
trading well in secondary."


""¦EIB is rarely in 30 years so there's a lot of demand for that paper."


""¦a good result. Plus 5bp is a very nice level."


""¦the back-up in yields was probably helpful and it shows there's very healthy
demand at the long end."


""¦a good outcome, with a good book. Clearly there was some marketing involved
as it was the 10th anniversary of the first CAB. I reckon they probably wanted a
bit of size, even though they tend to start these deals with a â,¬500m target.
Printing â,¬1bn always helps. Draghi's comments early in the week, though
tempered on Wednesday, probably also had a bearing in terms of appetite for
longer dated paper."

HEADLINE: 100 CEOs promise real climate risk disclosure

BYLINE: Jon Hay



HIGHLIGHT: The drive to get companies to face up to the risk of climate change
is gathering momentum. Firms with a combined market capitalisation of about
$3.5tr have committed to support the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which published its final report
on Thursday.

 BODY:

Financial institutions responsible for about $25tr of assets have also committed
to support the TCFD, a voluntary set of guidelines meant to be followed by all
issuers and investors, whether or shares, bonds or loans.

These figures have grown since December, when the TCFD published its draft
recommendations. At that point, firms backing the process were worth about
$2.5tr in total, while on the investor side $20tr of assets was involved.

The total market cap of the S&amp;P 500 is about $22tr, so the adherents are
already a sizeable group, but there is a long way to go before adoption becomes
ubiquitous. Even then, that will only be a beginning, as it can only be the
depth of risk management and planning that really begin to alter the trajectory
of climate change.

"It's fantastic that a group as diverse as the businesses that came together for
the Task Force, which included companies from the automotive and extractive
industries, could come up with such clear recommendations, and that we've got
100 CEOs backing it from the start," said Steve Waygood, chief responsible
investment officer at Aviva Investors in London. The effort was being endorsed
by "individuals at the very top of these institutions," he added. "It's not just
a sustainability officer or a pressure group. These are grown-up financial
institutions with senior people who have said that these are systemic risks that
need to be managed."

Waygood is a member of the Task Force but was speaking on his own behalf.
Mobilising capital

The TCFD is an effort, initiated in December 2015 by the Financial Stability
Board of the G20, to get the capital markets pushing in the right direction on
climate change.

The idea is that if companies report on how they perceive the risks they face
from climate change, and how they plan to deal with them, they will no longer be
able to put off thinking about it.

Crucially, these disclosures must be made in core financial filings such as
quarterly and annual reports "" not in a side document that can be ignored or
belittled.

At the same time, investors will be able to push companies to do better, and
move money to the firms they think are best prepared for climate change.
Investors in their turn must report to their own stakeholders.

"One of the most important recommendations, and it's squarely at the front of
the entire recommendations," said Waygood, "is the role of the board. They have
said very clearly that it is a legitimate role for the governing mind of the
firm to consider what are the climate risks the business faces. This should set
a new norm in the corporate governance community that climate change is a
governance matter."

It follows from this that companies' business strategies should reflect and
incorporate these risks.

"The third thing is that their internal risk control function should be looking
at climate change risks "" physical, litigation, transition risks "" that these
are the correct jurisdiction of the risk committee, and if they are not looking
at them, they are reneging on their responsibilities," said Waygood. Imagine the
unthinkable

The TCFD asks companies and investors to do forward scenario planning ""
imagining what the world might be like if it warms by, say, 2C or 3C, and
working out how their business would adapt.

"Different firms are exposed in different ways," said Waygood. "We as an
insurance company have said the insurance sector faces an existential threat
beyond 4C. If you are a coal company, you are exposed at the end of the
transition. We need a smooth, managed transition to a zero carbon economy, and
the first thing you need for that is information, so these scenario plans are
important."

The final report includes modifications and clarifications from the draft, after
300 responses were received to the consultation, from 30 countries.

These include making it clear that companies are expected to disclose on
Strategy and Metrics &amp; Targets only if climate risks would be material to
their business "" but should disclose on their Governance and Risk Management,
whether climate appears material to them or not.

Organisations with more than $1bn of annual revenue are encouraged to be more
careful, and to assess their strategy in the light of the climate, even if the
risks are not material enough to warrant putting it in the annual report.

All organisations that face material risks are expected to make remuneration
policies take account of climate risk planning.

For asset owners and managers, the recommended carbon footprinting metric has
been changed from greenhouse gas emissions associated with investments,
normalised for every million of the reporting currency, to a weighted average
carbon-intensity metric.

But in the main, the final recommendations are those presented in December's
draft. Big hitters on board

Among the chief executive signatories are Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, Jes
Staley of Barclays, Michael Corbat of Citigroup, Stuart Gulliver of HSBC, Shu Gu
of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Ralph Hamers of ING, James Gorman of
Morgan Stanley and Sergio Ermotti of UBS.

Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have not yet added
their names.

Among big fossil fuel and energy-related companies, BNP Billiton, Royal Dutch
Shell, EDF, Enel, Engie, Eni, Glencore and Iberdrola are on board.

The recommendations are now complete, but the Task Force's mandate has been
extended until 2018, to promote and encourage implementation. It has already
contacted hundreds of companies and thousands of investors to get them
interested.

The big hope of TCFD supporters is that the G20 heads of government, to whom the
report will be presented at the Hamburg summit on July 7-8, will give it strong
backing. But this looks much less certain since President Donald Trump pulled
the US out of the Paris Agreement on June 1.

"There's a need to encourage this voluntary framework," said Waygood. "When the
heads of [government] meet in Hamburg it's really important they give it as
strong a backing as they can. The industry-led nature of this Task Force means
it's different and distinct [from the Paris Agreement] and should be welcomed by
all heads of state. As an insurer and business we need the backing of government
to ensure the economy grows in a sustainable way."

The European Commission's High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, which
produces its first report in mid-July, is looking at ways to promote adoption of
the TCFD disclosures in Europe.

Already, France's decision to enshrine carbon and climate reporting requirements
on investors in Article 173 of its Energy Transition Law is having a marked
effect, increasing the demands for information that French asset owners such as
pension funds are making of asset managers. This should feed through to French
asset managers demanding more information from companies they invest in, whether
they are French or not.

"We need investors to take up the mantle," said Waygood. "We need asset owners
and managers to themselves demand that companies use the guidelines "" and we
need investors to be making investment decisions accordingly, so it informs the
discounted cashflow analysis, and how investors vote at AGMs."

In January, Aviva wrote to chairpeople of companies it invests in, warning them
that it would vote against their report and accounts starting from 2018, if they
did not use the TCFD disclosures. It has already done this since 2008 for
companies that do not make certain carbon disclosures.

HEADLINE: Aussie Super Launches SRI Option

BODY:

VicSuper, a Melbourne-based fund with AUD17 billion (GBP10 billion) in assets
for the South Eastern Australian state of Victoria, has set up a socially
responsible investment option following increased demand from its members.
According to CIO Andrew Howard, VicSuper was one of the first superannuation
funds to offer an investment option of this kind when it launched its Equity
Growth Sustainability option in 2001. The scheme has, however, revamped it into
the Socially Conscious investment option. The "~new look' option allows fund
members to invest in a socially responsible way, he explained.

"VicSuper has offered a responsible investment option for years and we believe
that it's important to offer our members choice," Howard noted. Socially
Conscious was launched so that it has competitive investment fees, and shifted
the asset allocation to a medium risk profile to open up access to more members.
"I'm happy to report the number of members and the value of funds under
management in Socially Conscious is already growing," he added, without
disclosing any numbers or which external fund manager would be in charge of
managing the option.

The scheme conducted a survey of its members in relation to the Socially
Conscious option, and 84% of those surveyed indicated that they would consider
moving some or all their investments to it. This sentiment is supported by
recent social research undertaken by Sustainability Victoria, which shows that
four out of five Victorians are willing to take action on environmental and
social issues like climate change.

The fund will not invest in companies that hold fossil fuel reserves used for
energy purposes or whose principal business revenue is derived from direct
fossil fuel activities, Howard disclosed. He also said that the investment
option will minimise social harm by not investing in companies that are
materially involved in activities that potentially cause social harm, for
example tobacco production, alcohol, gambling, military weapons, civilian
firearms, pornography and genetically modified organisms.

Howard believes the option will protect human rights, labour rights and the
environment by not investing in companies that have been involved in severe
incidents and/or controversies, or have been found to not be adhering to widely
accepted global conventions. He added that these objectives apply to the
equities component of the option, which invests in companies sourced from a
custom index designed for VicSuper that combines the MSCI Global Fossil Fuels
Exclusion Index, the MSCI Global Socially Responsible Index and an additional
fossil fuel direct activity screen.

The other asset classes in the option integrate an environment, social and
governance (ESG) approach, Howard noted. The Socially Conscious investment
option has been certified by the Responsible Investment Association of Australia
as a SRI option.

HEADLINE: Australia recommits to Paris agreement after Trump's withdrawal;
Energy minister Josh Frydenberg says he's disappointed with US decision but
believes 26-28% emissions reductions by 2030 on 2050 levels are reasonable

BYLINE: Gabrielle Chan

BODY:

The Coalition government has recommitted to Australia's emissions targets in the
Paris agreement after Donald Trump's withdrawal but Malcolm Turnbull faces
internal division as conservative MPs celebrated the American decision.

The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was disappointed
with Trump's decision but reiterated the Turnbull government's full commitment
to the Paris deal.

"We reiterate our full commitment to the Paris Accord," Frydenberg told the ABC.
"We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions
by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable.

accord - live

"I do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement. You have more than
190 countries that signed on, and in record time, 146 countries have ratified.
So even without the US, around 70% of the world's emissions are covered by that
agreement."

But Liberal MP and chair of the backbench environment committee, Craig Kelly,
who was at the forefront of the campaign which forced Frydenberg to rule out any
form of carbon trading, had "champagne on ice" waiting for the US withdrawal.

Early on Friday morning, he posted "THEY'RE OUT" on his Facebook page and
welcomed the decision with a video of Whitney Houston singing the Star Spangled
Banner.

"There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it's
just that mankind hasn't yet worked it out," Kelly said.

"But if our history tells us anything, we are more likely to discover that new
technology by combining free market capitalism with the wealth created by fossil
fuels than we are through central planning and government imposed regulations
that destroy wealth."

With Turnbull in Singapore for bilateral annual leaders talks, Frydenberg said
it was important to have the United States in the agreement as the second
largest emitter. But he insisted the Paris Agreement remained meaningful.

Asked about Trump's previous comments that climate change was a Chinese hoax,
Frydenberg said there was broad global understanding about the significance of
climate change.

Frydenberg praised the US economy for having its lowest emissions intensity in
more than two decades partly due to gas exploration.

"It's got its lowest emissions intensity in more than 20 years and one of the
reasons for that is the shale gas revolution which has seen gas overtake coal as
a major energy source," he said.

"But here in Australia, we're at the lowest emissions intensity on a GDP and per
capita basis in 27 years. So Australia is transforming and we are supporting
that transition in a way that ensures energy affordability and energy security."

But the decision increases pressure on Turnbull ahead of the chief scientist
Alan Finkel's report which will be released at the council of Australian
governments (Coag) report next Friday.

The government has already ruled out any form of carbon trading to appease more
conservative MPs in the Coalition party room even though industry groups believe
Finkel will recommend a version of emissions intensity scheme for the
electricity sector as one of the more preferable options. Finkel gave support to
such a scheme in his preliminary report late last year.

Frydenberg doubled down against any form of emissions intensity scheme following
Trump's decision but predicted there would be big battles within the Coalition
this week ahead of Trump's decision.

"It would push out, faster than the system can cope, brown and black coal
generators and right now, after we saw the blackout in South Australia, which
was a disaster for the people and the businesses of that state, we can't afford
to compromise energy security and energy affordability," Frydenberg said.

"That's why it's a dilemma that we face."

Senior Labor frontbencher Penny Wong said it was a deep disappointment that the
US withdrew from the agreement which represented the most significant global
action to deal with climate change.

Wong noted China had continued to express its support for the Paris Agreement
overnight but said any agreement needs the United States.

"The United States is a global leader; whatever it does, matters," Wong said.

She called on the prime minister to be absolutely clear with the US
administration to continue to press Donald Trump on climate change. Wong said
she was disappointed to see members of the Coalition publicly advocating for the
US withdraw.

Kelly told Guardian Australia that while he celebrated the US decision, he did
not believe Australia should withdraw from the agreement yet but should monitor
its effects on the economy.

He said for the US, the Paris Agreement gave China a huge advantage over the US.

"After those negotiations China would have walked away from table laughing at
the US because they can increase their emissions to their heart's content,"
Kelly said.

He said his concern was Australian would also be giving up its international
competitive advantage of cheaper energy costs.

"Look at the Renewable Energy Target, we have simply spent a lot of money with
not a lot of result," Kelly said.

He said Australia needed affordable and reliable electricity supplies and "at
moment we are getting neither" and the country was simply exporting jobs to
China.

HEADLINE: Obama condemns Trump for 'rejecting the future' by exiting Paris deal;

Former president had spent years negotiating for landmark climate accord Mitch
McConnell: 'Trump has put families and jobs ahead of leftwing ideology'

BYLINE: Sabrina Siddiqui and Lauren Gambino in Washington

BODY:

Barack Obama led condemnation of his successor's decision to withdraw from the
landmark Paris climate accord, which the former president's administration
painstakingly negotiated over the course of several years.

In a statement released just before Donald Trump officially announced that the
US would remove itself from the deal, Obama said the administration had joined
"a small handful of nations that reject the future". He warned that the more
than 190 countries that remain participants will "reap the benefits in jobs and
industries created", but he said that US states, cities and businesses "will
step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future
generations the one planet we've got."

The rare rebuke by Obama was testament to the magnitude of Trump's decision. The
former president has commented sparingly on the new administration, weighing in
only on matters he has framed as of moral significance, such as Trump's stymied
effort to impose a travel ban on refugees and citizens from several
Muslim-majority countries.

Trump's withdrawal from the accord was not just a blow to one of Obama's
signature achievements, but to an issue routinely dubbed by the Obama
administration as the greatest threat to US national security and future
generations across the globe.

In exiting the agreement, the US joined only Syria and Nicaragua in sitting on
the sidelines even as widespread condemnation poured in from foreign leaders,
climate scientists and many leading US companies.

The reaction in Washington was nonetheless split on familiar partisan lines,
with Republican lawmakers near unanimously throwing their support behind Trump
while Democrats vowed revenge at the ballot box.

Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who have long sought to thwart
Obama's environmental legacy, applauded Trump in their statements.

"The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America," Ryan said,
adding: "In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government
must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for
fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad
deal."

McConnell said Trump's move followed through on congressional action "to rebuff
then-President Obama's regulatory rampage".

"When the previous administration signed America up for this unattainable
mandate, we made it clear we would fight this unilateral action any way we
could, and this day could not have happened soon enough," McConnell said.
"President Trump has once again put families and jobs ahead of leftwing ideology
and should be commended for his action."

Democrats, by contrast, were scathing in their assessment of Trump's decision,
with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer declaring it "a devastating failure of
historic proportions".

"Future generations will look back on President Trump's decision as one of the
worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our
economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing," Schumer said. "Pulling
out of the Paris agreement doesn't put America first, it puts America last in
recognizing science, in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line,
our economy and our planet."

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who made climate change a pillar of his bid
for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, decried Trump's action as "an
abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace."

"When climate change is already causing devastating harm, we don't have the
moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet," Sanders
tweeted.

At least one senator, Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, appeared to be
at a loss for words.

"Dear planet, we're sorry," Murphy tweeted. "Please just hang on for three and a
half more years and we'll fix this. We promise".

HEADLINE: Interesting times for lepidopterists;
Conditions over the past few years are putting stress on butterfly populations
as food sources are diminished, but certain species are thriving

BYLINE: Patrick Barkham

BODY:

A beautiful creature has fluttered into my path. Well, actually, it landed on
the doormat with a resounding thud. The Butterflies of Sussex might sound of
limited geographical interest but it's the best new butterfly guidebook in the
country.

Newcomers will enjoy the fascinating anecdotes and beautiful photos by
lepidopterist Neil Hulme. Obsessives searching for the elusive purple emperor
will gobble up the grid references for the "master trees" around which male
emperors congregate shortly after midsummer.

When I spoke to co-author Michael Blencowe about this summer, he declared that
the cavalry - rain - had turned up just in time. Butterflies thrive in sunny,
dry conditions but drought can cause problems by killing the leaves on which
caterpillars, which should become midsummer's butterflies, feed. Blencowe also
fears that late frosts, which killed emerging oak leaves, will reduce the number
of purple hairstreaks in July.

At least this summer is better than the "new kind of hell" of 2016 - a
gloriously sunny July and August with almost no butterflies. This was because a
mild winter had proved fatal for many. "Butterflies have been surviving strange
weather - snow and cold - for years," said Blencowe. "But when unusual
conditions come for three or four consecutive years, that's when we'll lose
species."

Blencowe has recorded big changes over the past five years, mostly because of
climate change. The warmth-loving silver-spotted skipper has moved from rare
butterfly to Sussex stalwart. "This is the kind of thing I thought would happen
over decades, not over the span of a five-year survey," says Blencowe. "It's
interesting times, but not always in a good way."

HEADLINE: Donald Trump's Paris pullout is more damaging to the US than the
climate;
The US abandoning the global climate deal brings risks, but the unity of the
rest of the world and plummeting green energy costs are reasons for hope Live
coverage: Trump pulls US out of Paris climate agreement

BYLINE: Damian Carrington Environment editor

BODY:

Will Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change
agreement tip the world into fiery catastrophe? The extraordinary unity of the
rest of the world's nations in tackling global warming, allied with the booming
green economy, driven by plummeting renewable energy costs, are strong reasons
to think not.

Related:  Donald Trump confirms US will quit Paris climate deal

A much more likely casualty of Trump's choice is the US economy he claims to be
protecting: America's brilliance at innovation, investment and building
businesses will no longer have its government's support. The prize of leadership
in the 21st-century economy could be sacrificed in a doomed attempt to revive
the fossil-fuelled economy of the 20th century.

However much Trump "digs coal", he cannot force companies to build coal-fired
power stations if wind and solar are cheaper and executives are smart enough to
realise that a billion-dollar bet on a new plant - likely to be closed by
Trump's successor - is not a winner.

Instead, US states and cities will continue to pursue the green future that
secures clean air, water and the promise of climate stability for their
citizens. That is no small deal: combined together, California and New York City
would be the fourth biggest economy in the world.

Climate change is, of course, a global issue but, around the globe, leaders from
China to India to Russia to the European Union have lined up to reassert their
commitment to confronting the greatest challenge faced by civilisation. Most
remarkable is China, the world's biggest polluter, which has transitioned from
climate laggard to climate leader in recent years.

Can China be relied upon to match its words with action? The answer is yes,
because its determination is not founded on lofty altruism but the hard-headed
need to protect its vast population from the air pollution and looming water and
food problems that stem from carbon emissions. Furthermore, China is coming to
dominate the supply of renewable energy technology.

But the US pullout still undoubtedly brings risks for the rest of the world.
There are lots of possible pathways to the zero-emission global economy needed
in the second half of this century to avoid the " severe, widespread and
irreversible impacts " warned of by the world's scientists. But the best is to
start early, with global carbon emissions starting to fall by 2020.

Even a flattening of the decline in US carbon emissions - if not compensated for
by other nations - will slow progress and might bump up global warming by a
tenth of a degree or two. That could be enough to push the most vulnerable
nations under the waves of a rising ocean.

A rogue US, exporting goods manufactured with dirty energy, might tempt other
nations to weaken their climate commitments in order to compete, although there
is no sign of this at present. Alternatively, other countries could punish the
US with heavy carbon taxes on its exports. But that would prompt retaliation,
with unpredictable consequences.

The US has also been a major funder of climate aid programmes, which have been
vital in winning over developing nations that view global warming as a crisis
inflicted on them by industrialised nations. Billions more will have to be
contributed by the richest nations.

But the breakthrough in Paris - getting the unanimous agreement of 196 nations
to tackle climate change together - remains a deceptively solid foundation for
beating global warming, a task that will take decades not years.

German environment minister Barbara Hendricks said on Thursday: "The world's
climate will survive for eight years without the US." But, despite the good
reasons for optimism, a one-term Trump presidency would be even safer.

HEADLINE: Air pollution doesn't just harm humans - it is destroying nature too;

The poisonous residue from car exhausts is causing a public health crisis - and
could be the death of sparrows too

BYLINE: Michael McCarthy

BODY:

You may never have heard of cow parsley syndrome, yet it's been visible over
much of Britain for the past month - the spectacle of country roads fringed with
a dense throng of tall white feathery flowers, three- to four-feet high, which
many people now think of as an attractive addition to the landscape. It's a pity
they do, for the point about the syndrome is this: there's lots of cow parsley,
sure. But there isn't anything else.

Related:  UK government sued for third time over illegal air pollution from
diesels

Along mile after mile of our rural highways, especially the closer you get to
London, every spring you will see masses of this frothy foam. But what you often
won't find is the lovely variety of wildflowers that 30 to 40 years ago
decorated these same roadside verges: comfrey, lady's smock, white dead-nettle,
garlic mustard, bird's-foot trefoil, ox-eye daisy, early purple orchid and many
more. The cow parsley has largely crowded them out because it has been
fertilised into excessive growth. Much of the fertiliser has come in the form of
nitrogen compounds from car exhausts, especially diesel ones - a striking
example of how air pollution from motor vehicles is impacting on the natural
world.

We know only too well how it impacts on us. Causing up to  40,000 premature
deaths a year, air pollution in Britain is now right at the top of our list of
environmental health concerns. It is seen in human terms as a crisis and a
public health emergency. Vehicle emissions are breaking EU air quality laws, and
the government has had to be ordered by the supreme court to find an effective
strategy.

People get that. Absolutely. But what is not nearly so well appreciated is the
way in which air pollution is now playing havoc with the natural environment
too, principally through the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds and
perhaps also through particulates, the microscopic soot particles that diesel
engines emit.

It is the nitrogen that is doing the most obvious damage. To understand it, you
need to grasp the key fact about our wildflowers, which is strongly
counterintuitive: that to flourish, most of them need poor soil. Poor soil
allows a wide variety of wild plants to coexist; but a rich soil full of
nutrients such as nitrogen means that a small number of robust and resilient
plants, especially certain grass species and others such as stinging nettles,
brambles and indeed Anthriscus sylvestris, as cow parsley is scientifically
named, will be able to outcompete everything else.

This is not just an impression: the supporting data is there, in the Countryside
Survey, the enormous census of the habitats and vegetation of rural Britain that
the government carries out every 10 years, and it shows that there is more than
half as much again of cow parsley along our roadsides as there was 40 years ago.
More importantly, work by scientists such as Dr Carly Stevens of the University
of Lancaster has shown that there is a direct mathematical link between the
amount of nitrogen a habitat receives and its plant species-richness: the more
nitrogen it gets, the fewer species it supports, which is why many lovely
wildflowers are disappearing.

Two months ago the wildflower charity Plantlife produced a vivid report sounding
the alarm about this situation - it said that nitrogen pollution was now a
greater danger to our wildflowers than climate change - but although the report
was well reviewed, it seems clear that the scale of the threat has still not
generally sunk in.

This is unfortunate, because we are also beginning to understand that more
organisms than plants are being affected by air pollution. It is highly likely
that there is a substantial knock-on effect for insects and other invertebrates,
and this may be one of the causes of the catastrophic crash of insect
populations in parts of Europe highlighted in a recent issue of the journal
Science.

Most remarkable of all, air pollution may be behind the greatest environmental
mystery in Britain of the past 25 years: the sudden disappearance of house
sparrows from central London in the early 1990s. The world expert on the
sparrow, Dr Denis Summers-Smith, believes particulate pollution is to blame
(although he does not have proof).

Certainly, something catastrophic happened in the house sparrow ecosystem in the
capital; whether it was connected to the widespread uptake of diesel vehicles
remains to be investigated. It is a reasonable assumption that a phenomenon that
is thought to trigger nearly 10,000 premature deaths a year in London alone may
well have had just as drastic an effect on the capital's smaller inhabitants.
Yes, air pollution kills. It kills us, but it kills off the natural world just
as effectively.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump just cemented his legacy as America's worst-ever
president;
Trump is doing his best to ruin the world for our children and grandchildren

BYLINE: Dana Nuccitelli

BODY:

In an inexplicable abdication of any semblance of responsibility or leadership,
Donald Trump has announced that he will begin the process to withdraw the United
States from the Paris climate treaty, joining Nicaragua and Syria as the only
world countries rejecting the agreement. It now seems inevitable that the
history books will view Trump as America's worst-ever president.

If I and my advisors had never learned what Science is or how & why it works,
then I'd consider pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord too.- Neil deGrasse
Tyson (@neiltyson) June 1, 2017

Trump's withdrawal from the Paris treaty is a mostly symbolic act. America's
pledges to cut its carbon pollution were non-binding, and his administration's
policies to date had already made it impossible for America to meet its initial
Paris climate commitment for 2025. The next American president in 2020 can
re-enter the Paris treaty and push for policies to make up some of the ground we
lost during Trump's reign.

However, withdrawing from the Paris treaty is an important symbolic move - a
middle finger to the rest of the world, and to future generations. America is by
far the largest historical contributor to climate change. Ironically, on the
heels of Trump's claim that most NATO members aren't paying their fair share to
the organization, America has announced that we won't do our fair share to curb
the climate change threats that we are the most responsible for.

The Rotting Republican Party

And the GOP has become the Party of Trump. His decision was reinforced by a
letter from 22 Republican senators urging withdrawal from the Paris climate
treaty. Those senators have coincidentally received over $10m in donations from
the fossil fuel industry over the past five years.

Their reasoning was dubious at best, arguing that environmental attorneys will
cite the international agreement in their efforts to prevent the Trump
administration from eliminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan. By law, the
US government is required to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act,
because it poses a threat to public welfare. The Republican Senators wrote:

Environmentalists will argue that these [Clean Air Act] Section 115 requirements
are, in fact, met more easily by the Paris Agreement because it includes
enhanced transparency requirements in Article 13, which establishes a process
for nations to submit plans to reduce emissions to one another and then to
comment on the plans of one another.

As National Resource Defense Council climate and clean air program senior
attorney David Doniger explained to me, this argument is nonsense:

They are making things up. EPA did not rely on Paris to justify the Clean Power
Plan, and none of the parties defending the Plan has cited Paris as a legal
basis. On Clean Air Act Section 115, no one I know has made, or even thought of,
this argument.

It's difficult to discern the Republican Senators' motivations behind this
letter. Even big oil and coal and many of America's largest companies supported
America staying in the Paris agreement. Industries don't like the uncertainty
involved in lurching in and out of international treaties, and experts are
concerned about the effect on America's international influence from tearing up
this critically important agreement that we helped broker less than two years
ago, that was signed by nearly every world country.

Perhaps the Republican Senators are trying to ride Trump's nationalist,
anti-globalist coattails. Maybe they think that their right-wing base will be
excited if they stick it to the rest of the world on Paris. However, majorities
of voters in every single county in the US support regulating carbon as a
pollutant, and 71% of Americans ( including 57% of Republicans ) think the US
should participate in the Paris agreement.

constituents disagree. pic.twitter.com/pj3hlQeKw3 - Yale Climate Program
(@YaleClimateComm) May 30, 2017

In short, efforts to pull out of the Paris treaty are woefully misguided, and
almost everyone knows it. Everyone except 42% of Senate Republicans including
leader Mitch McConnell, James Inhofe, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and of course Trump's
senior advisor Steve Bannon and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt.
Additionally, the Koch brothers and Vladimir Putin are not fans of the treaty.
Those two factors may best explain this decision by Trump and the Republican
senators.

Good luck kids, you'll need it

Political calculations aside, pulling America out of the Paris agreement is
grossly immoral. Human-caused climate change puts the well-being of our children
and grandchildren at risk. That's especially true for poorer countries that lack
the resources to adapt to its impacts, and that contributed the least to the
problem. However, the move will also hurt the American economy, as Joseph
Robertson wrote on these pages earlier this week:

With China, India, and the EU all moving toward record investments in clean
energy and high-efficiency construction, transport and industrial production,
withdrawal from the Paris Agreement risks making the US into an economic
backwater. Withdrawal would effectively deprive American businesses and
communities of the most efficient ways to boost investment, hiring, innovation,
and return on investment.

Some Republican leaders are struggling to preserve their party's credibility and
viability. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) warned against
the withdrawal. 20 House Republicans have now joined the bipartisan Climate
Solutions Caucus, whose goal is to craft economically beneficial climate
policies that both parties can support. And a group of Republican elder
statesmen including Secretaries of State and Treasury to Presidents Reagan,
George HW Bush, and George W Bush met with the White House seeking support for a
revenue-neutral carbon tax plan.

So far, these leaders' laudable efforts have failed. Trump and the majority of
Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to increase American
carbon pollution. They want to repeal all of America's climate policies with no
replacement plan. In short, they're happy to let the world burn, and for our
children and grandchildren suffer the consequences.

2020 election will be a climate referendum

This is the rotten state of today's GOP. They're happy to sell out the future of
humanity for their own short-term political gain. Noam Chomsky was right - the
Republican Party may be the most dangerous organization in human history. This
move comes at a time when the need to act on global warming has been clear for
decades, but the GOP has blocked all American climate policy efforts, and we're
now running out of time to avoid dangerous climate change.

Trump, per a source, will follow the 4-yr rule to get out of Paris, meaning the
US will leave on Nov 4, 2020. Election Day 2020: Nov 3.- Dan Merica
(@danmericaCNN) June 1, 2017

America's withdrawal from the Paris treaty will take four years, meaning that
the 2020 election (and the 2018 midterms) will be a referendum on Trump's
decision today. American voters must send the world a signal in that election.
In the meantime, it will be up to the rest of the world - particularly China and
the EU - to take up the mantle of leadership on climate change that America has
left behind.

HEADLINE: China and the EU confront Trump on climate change. May just fawns over
him;
The Paris agreement is facing a mortal, US-led threat. But at this crucial
moment, our prime minister is, once again, absent, silent and weak

BYLINE: Ed Davey

BODY:

The most important international agreement to tackle climate change is about to
be dealt a severe blow - but Theresa May is nowhere to be found.

Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement,
in which 195 countries signed up to ambitious targets to arrest the rise in
global temperatures. Such a decision from the US will heighten the risk of a
climate disaster, with all the damaging consequences to food supply, the global
economy and our security.

Related:  World urges Donald Trump not to dump Paris climate agreement

Experts in the UK have made clear that climate change is a grave threat to
national security, and Trump's own defence secretary has issued the same warning
for the US. Donald Trump's actions put us all in greater peril.

Yet in the face of this threat, May is silent. We have a prime minister who is
weak on the world stage and complicit in Trump's world-harming act. While our
European neighbours are joining with China and other developing countries to
confront Trump and strengthen their efforts on climate change, Theresa May
hasn't issued a word of criticism. Whereas France's new president used his first
meeting with Trump to press him to stay in the Paris agreement, our prime
minister failed to even mention it during her fawning trip to Washington in
January.

This is unacceptable. Just as Donald Trump is abrogating America's
responsibility to lead the fight against climate change, Theresa May is evading
Britain's role. Instead of holding hands with Trump at the White House and
rolling out the red carpet for him in London, the prime minister must stand up
to him and convince him to keep America in the Paris agreement. Instead of the
lavish trappings of a state visit, Trump should be greeted with robust British
diplomacy. After all, what is the good of a special relationship unless we're
prepared to use it?

What's most disappointing about May's failure is that Britain played such a
pivotal role in securing the agreement

May's lack of leadership on this issue is appalling, but perhaps not all that
surprising. One of her first acts as prime minister was to abolish the
Department of Energy and Climate Change. She's sold off the Green Investment
Bank that we established in coalition, and is now calling for a fracking
"revolution". Nick Timothy, her chief of staff and righthand man, wrongly called
the Climate Change Act a "monstrous act of self-harm". No wonder her policy on
climate change is so weak.

What's most disappointing about May's failure on climate change is that Britain
played such a pivotal role in securing international agreement on it in the
first place. As the energy and climate change secretary in the coalition
government, I led the negotiations for an ambitious EU commitment that paved the
way for success at the Paris conference. It was a clear demonstration of the
influence Britain can wield as a member of the EU - influence that is
particularly crucial in the face of global threats such as climate change. Only
through international cooperation will we prevent catastrophe.

humiliating defeat | Fiona Harvey

We now have to face the reality of an American president who ignores the
scientific consensus that climate change is real and calls it a Chinese hoax.
Clearly reason and evidence won't change Trump's mind, so we must bring
international pressure to bear instead. If Trump does not face a backlash from
the UK and other nations over this, he will take it as a sign that he can ride
roughshod over any number of other international agreements in the future.

With Donald Trump in the White House, British leadership on the world stage is
more important than ever. We should be working with our European allies, not
turning them into opponents. We should be redoubling our own efforts to combat
climate change, not watering them down. And we should be speaking out loud and
clear against Trump's irresponsibility. If this election is about leadership,
it's clear yet again that Theresa May has been found wanting.

HEADLINE: Climate change isn't just a concern for the 1% - but it often seems
so;
Bankers and celebrities are often on the forefront of climate change
discussions. Does that harm, rather than help, the cause?

BYLINE: Kate Aronoff

BODY:

All signs now point to Donald Trump withdrawing the United States from the Paris
Climate Agreement, the closest thing the international community has to a plan
for dealing with climate change.

In the lead-up to this week's expected decision, the nationalist, Steve
Bannon-lead wing of the White House has tried to paint climate change - and the
agreement, by extension - as a concern of elites.

Headlines on Breitbart over the weekend derided Gary Cohn (" Carbon Tax Cohn ",
to some) for trying to change Trump's mind about pulling out of the deal,
complete with a globe emoji alongside the Goldman Sachs veteran's name - a
double entendre for his belief in globalization and global warming.

Real Americans care about reviving the beleaguered coal industry and unleashing
the power of America's natural resources to create jobs, their argument goes.
The only people who care about climate change are bankers and celebrities.

The problem is that they aren't entirely wrong - at least from looking at
headlines.

Billionaires like Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio have become some of the most
recognizable faces of the fight against climate change for producing
high-profile documentaries on the subject and jetting around the world to spread
their gospel. Elon Musk - the Tesla CEO now under fire for mistreating his
workers - has been celebrated by environmentalists for building electric cars
and batteries to store solar power.

Climate change is a frequent topic of conversation at 1 percent confabs like the
World Economic Forum in Davos, where this year's 15 sessions on climate featured
60 CEOs. Over the last several weeks, greens like the Natural Resources Defense
Council have touted the fact that corporations like Walmart, BP and Unilever all
favor sticking with Paris.

Even JP Morgan Chase head and Trump advisor Jamie Dimon has joined the fold,
signing onto a letter with Musk and business magnates in the Wall Street Journal
expressing their "strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris
Climate Agreement."

Especially given the scale of change needed, "believes in climate change" - or
in remaining in the Paris Agreement, for that matter - is a godawful litmus test
for deciding who gets to be called a climate hero. If there is a pragmatic
economic case to be made for switching over to renewables and divesting from
fossil fuel assets then elites will chase profits. They don't need to be lauded
for doing so.

Moreover, continuing to praise bankers and billionaires for symbolic statements
on climate helps do Bannon and Breitbart's work for them. In populist times,
salvaging any hope for real progress on climate change "post-Paris" -
domestically and internationally - will mean making the case for taking on
climate change in strictly populist terms.

Luckily, that case practically makes itself. The brand of climate denial that
informs Trump and the Republican party line is the result of one of the global
elite's most effective projects yet. It's been multinational corporations
funding the campaign to cast doubt on scientific consensus. ExxonMobil, for
instance, has poured at least $33m into such efforts since the Kyoto Protocol
was launched in 1997. Despite this long-running disinformation campaign, the
majority of voters in every state support the United States' participation in
the agreement.

What's more, any reasonable solution to climate change will require massive
amounts of job creation, putting people to work doing everything from installing
solar panels to insulating houses to updating the country's electric grid to
nursing and teaching, jobs in two of the country's already low-carbon sectors.

"If you are genuinely serious about shifting to a low-carbon society within the
timeframe we have, then it is an absolute agenda for jobs," climate scientist
Kevin Anderson said earlier this year. "You are guaranteeing full employment for
30 years if we think climate change is a serious issue. If we don't, we can
carry on with structural unemployment."

Climate policies can improve people's lives in the here and now while preventing
a truly catastrophic end to the 21st century. So don't chide Trump and the rest
of his party for denying climate change when they pull out of the Paris
Agreement. Chide them for denying millions of Americans the well-paying jobs and
stable future they deserve.

The silver lining of the climate crisis is that it may be the United States'
greatest opportunity yet to upend its vastly unequal economy, and kick the
executives who engineered both out of power. It's one of history's greatest "us
v them" scenarios, pitting a handful of oligarchs and profit-hungry fossil fuel
CEOs against the rest of humanity. Let's not let those optics go to waste.

HEADLINE: New species discovered behind a pub - then saved from extinction;
In 2007, conservationists discovered a new species inhabiting a beach just
behind a pub in Granity, New Zealand. But could they save it before erosion and
rising waters wiped it off the face of the planet?

BYLINE: Jeremy Hance

BODY:

Who says village life has to be boring? Granity, New Zealand may be home to less
than 300 people, but this lovely seaside village on the western coast of South
Island was also - until last year - home to a species found no-where else on
Earth. And today, the town has quite the tale to tell.

In 2007 reptile expert Tony Jewell noticed there was something very different
about the little lizards that skittered beneath the cobble stones on the beach
behind Miners on Sea pub and hotel in Granity. Built in 1892, the pub has a long
history of serving nearby mining communities.

Jewell was so convinced of the reptile's distinctness that he included them as a
separate species in his 2008 edition of A Photographic Guide to Reptiles and
Amphibians of New Zealand. Although similar to the more common speckled skink,
these Miners-on-Sea skinks were smaller and sported bigger eyes.

"Perhaps adaptations to wriggling through the gloomy spaces beneath the
'cobble'," Richard Gibson, with the Auckland Zoo, explained.

Conservationists began referring to this population as 'cobble skinks,' since
they only inhabited the cobble stones that lined the beach near Granity.

But things quickly became dire for the newly discovered skinks. Eight years
after Jewell discovered the population, two surveys, one in 2015 and 2016,
counted only around 30 animals left.

The species' habitat was rapidly disintegrating due to coastal erosion. In part,
this was because of changes inland where fewer rocks from the mountains were
making their way to the beaches of Granity. At the same time, rising sea levels
and higher storm surges - caused by climate change - may have also been washing
cobble stones - and lizards - out to sea.

"Historically, when the skink's habitat has been eroded they have been able to
migrate inland however, the area behind the beach is now covered in houses and
lawns," Scott Freeman with the Department of Conservation said. Cobble-loving
skinks can't survive on lawns.

Exacerbating habitat destruction, the skinks were also facing a threat shared
with almost all New Zealand's native animals: invasive predators like cats and
rats. Before humans arrived on New Zealand, it was a land of birds, weird, wild,
strange birds like the now extinct family of giant moas and the still-surviving
kakapo. The arrival of humans wiped out many of New Zealand's species, including
all of its moas. Human-brought mammals - like rats, mice, cats, hedgehogs,
sheep, and dogs - wiped out others. Cobble skinks had hung on until now.

With only a few dozen left, conservationists decided something had to be done -
and fast. Spring 2016 brought unusually high tides and storm surges, even as
conservationists headed to the beach just behind Miners on Sea to implement
Operation Skink Rescue. Over the next few months, they employed artificial rocks
to entice the skinks to hide under them with funnel traps inside to catch them.
Captured skinks were flown to Auckland Zoo where Gibson, the curator of birds
and ectotherms, oversees their care. In all, conservationists captured 38
survivors.

Today, the total population has risen by two to 40, said Gibson: the extras are
"youngsters born here [at the zoo], the size of a wriggly matchstick, to mothers
who arrived pregnant."

A 2015 genetic study of the now-captive lizards surprised scientists: the cobble
skins are actually an interbreeding population of what were once four different
groups each with a separate common ancestor - scientists call such groups
'clades'. These four clades have been messily hybridizing for generations, over
time becoming a single species.

"This is a fascinating situation in evolutionary terms - not that unusual in
plants but extremely unusual in animals," Gibson said, adding that a paper
officially describing the cobble skink as a new species has yet to be written.

Locals have seen zero cobble skinks behind the pub since - and scientists aren't
expecting to find anymore. Over the last year, waves have washed their habitat
away.

Phil Perrott, co-owner of Miners on Sea pub and hotel, said the rescue operation
of the skinks was a "fantastic effort" by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation. According to Perrott, the conservationists not only saved the
skinks from worsening erosion and rising seas - but also from local joyriders.

Perrott said that the Regional Council - "who have their heads up their
proverbial," according to him - insisted that vehicles be allowed to drive on
the beach even though they knew it would threaten the near-extinct species.

But most people in the village "certainly take an interest in the skink's
survival," Perrott added. Indeed, the skink has been immortalized in a stone
sculpture at the village school.

Stories similar to the cobble skink's are only likely to become more common in
our age of mass extinction : just last year scientists announced the first
mammal extinction due to climate change. Like the cobble skink, the Bramble Cay
melomys  saw its habitat, in this case a cay in the Great Barrier Reef, flooded
by higher storm surges. Conservationists now lament that they didn't attempt a
captive breeding programme before the Bramble Cay melomys was lost.

Thanks to rapid action, the cobble skink's story isn't over yet. Researchers are
currently looking for areas where one day the skinks may be able to be
introduced back into the wild.

"The difficulty is finding sites that have suitable habitat and are not being
impacted by coastal erosion," Freeman said.

The Auckland Zoo expects to house the skinks - off exhibit - for several years
at least. Keepers are now working moving the skinks from quarantine cages into
more naturalistic enclosures to facilitate breeding.

"Without a captive programme [the cobble skink] will be extinct," said Gibson.
"Currently the programme might be considered an 'Ark' - the last hope for a
displaced species with nowhere to live in the wild - but soon we hope it will
become an active breeding and release programme, restoring the cobble skink to
its original, or as near as we can manage, home on the West Coast of New
Zealand."

According to Gibson, the "good zoos" of the modern era not only work to educate
visitors, but also participate in direct conservation efforts, such as captive
breeding, funding field programmes, and publishing papers on animal behavior and
biology that help field conservationists. The Auckland Zoo is even working to
turn an off-shore island into an invasive species-free sanctuary for threatened
New Zealand species.

Every year scientists discover on average about 18,000 new species. Few of these
make the headlines, but many are threatened with extinction on discovery. Worse
is the fact that thousands of species have probably already vanished before
scientists can document them. Discovery has become a race against time,
conservation a race against oblivion, and the financial resources to do both -
discover and conserve - remain far below what is required.

At least for the cobble skink, tomorrow is another day. And now Miners on Sea
not only has the best view in town, but also the wildest tale.

HEADLINE: Paris climate deal: what was agreed and does it matter if US
withdraws?;
If it pulls out, the US would be the only country to argue that the accord
demands too much of signatory nations

BYLINE: Emma Graham-Harrison

BODY:

The Paris climate pact agreed at the end of 2015 was a historic achievement
after more than two decades of failed efforts to reach a global consensus on
climate change. It became legally binding about a year later, after countries
responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions had ratified it.

Only two countries have not joined : Syria, which was crippled by war at the
time of negotiations, and Nicaragua, which refused to sign up because it
considered the deal too weak. Therefore, if the US pulls out on Thursday - as is
expected - it would be the only country in the world to argue that the Paris
accord demands too much of signatory nations.

What does it commit member states to doing?

The Paris deal bridged yawning divides on how to limit emissions, partly by
focusing more on ambitions than obligations. It aims to keep the overall
increase in global temperatures below 2C, with an aspiration of limiting them to
1.5C. Scientists say these are the largest increases possible without risking
catastrophic and irreversible change in the world's climate.

Developed and developing countries, which squabbled for years about who should
foot the bill for cleaner growth, must all limit their emissions and try to
achieve a zero-emissions economy by the end of this century.

Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope
with the effects of extreme weather.

How effective will it be, if implemented fully?

There are no legally binding requirements, and even the voluntary caps on
emissions agreed so far are actually far too loose to hit the treaty's own
targets. Instead they are likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C. But
governments are committed to meet every five years to review targets and
progress, starting in 2023, potentially ramping up their goals.

Environmentalists and governments backed the compromise deal in the hope that it
would spur investment in clean technology, while both peer pressure and example
would spur officials to tackle their emissions.

There is some indication that just the existence of the deal is having a
positive effect, and the market for green energy is growing so fast that US
firms including Exxon Mobil are among those pushing Donald Trump to stay in.

Does it matter if the US leaves?

The US is not bound to any targets by the Paris accord, and is already moving
away from Barack Obama's commitment to cut emissions. It will continue to do so
regardless of whether it remains part of the global deal.

There are fears that formal withdrawal could dent the soft-power impact of the
agreement. But other major emitters including the European Union and China point
out that the US would be as free to rejoin as it is to leave.

They have vowed that their commitment to tackling climate change will not be
affected, perhaps bolstered by polls showing that the deal has the backing of a
firm majority of US voters.

HEADLINE: Trump smashes things like a toddler. Will the Paris agreement be
next?;
Despite fancying himself as some kind of master builder, he has only shown
himself to be a dismantler, a destroyer

BYLINE: Ross Barkan

BODY:

Donald Trump doesn't give much thought to his legacy because he has little
interest in living outside the blinding present. Ideas and impulses come and go,
defining national policy, rendering past and future meaningless. Now the world
trembles as this erratic president mulls whether to withdraw from a climate
change accord that may determine the course of the century.

If Trump moves to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, as he once vowed to
do as a candidate, he would successfully undercut global efforts to avert a
coming catastrophe. As the world's largest economy and second largest greenhouse
gas polluter, the United States cannot unilaterally destroy the 195-nation pact,
but it can encourage other nations more skeptical of the deal, like India and
the Philippines, to follow suit.

The goals of the agreement - to lower planet-warming emissions enough to
mitigate the extreme heat, massive storms and coastal flooding projected for the
coming decades - will be even harder to reach.

Trump is a climate change skeptic, a severe outlier on the world stage but not
so in his retrograde Republican party. Democrats, beset with their own
challenges and hypocrisies, at least understand that climate change poses an
existential threat. This is not like Trump hemming and hawing over pulling out
of Nato a military alliance that is not required to protect the stability of
human civilization. This is much worse.

But these are not terms Trump thinks in. Despite fancying himself as some kind
of master builder, he has only shown himself to be a dismantler, a destroyer.
His proposed budget guts the government programs needed by the most desperate
Americans, many of whom voted for him.

His obsession with repealing Obamacare, which no longer consumes most
rank-and-file Republicans now that Barack Obama has left office, will only
further destabilize healthcare markets and ensure the suffering of the oldest,
sickest and the poorest.

A true populist, even one disdainful of democratic institutions, would at least
try to protect the economic safety net that saves the very people who put him in
office. Not so with Trump. Maybe the most galling aspect of this new American
order is the lack of any organizing philosophy, a workable plan to replace the
things he wishes to dismantle. Like a toddler at play time, he smashes things
and refuses to clean up. His building blocks are left on the mat.

What could be gained from pulling America out of the Paris agreement or
introducing new caveats? Will a few more Trump voters cheer on their man for
staying true to his insanity? Maybe. But if the cult of Trump has proven one
thing, it's that it's forgiving of inconsistences. It will remain intact whether
the strongman swings left or right. It will be there for him if he decides to
reaffirm America's commitment to guarding the health of the planet.

To the people who voted for Trump in coal country, environmentalists will always
be the sworn enemy, even if it's ruthless corporate titans, technological
automation and the decline of unions which have doomed them. Trump's happy to
keep that canard alive. And he's just as happy to offer them nothing else.

Most politicians have a conception of what their utopia might look like, or at
least advance ideas or policies towards building a world they'd like to see.
Trump, ever more willing to co-opt the nihilism of his party's most right-wing
flank, has no use for seriously investing in his country or the world's
environmental sustainability. That would force him to think deeply about the
future. And everyone knows he doesn't make time for that.

HEADLINE: Paris climate deal: frustrated world leaders prepare to move on
without US;
Trump is reportedly poised to pull out of Paris - prompting murmurings that the
world would be better off without American involvement

BYLINE: Oliver Milman in New York

BODY:

Donald Trump's Twitter pledge to make a decision on whether to remain in the
Paris climate agreement this week promises resolution to months of fevered
lobbying over US involvement in the global accord.

But while America's traditional allies and environmental groups continue to urge
Trump to stay within the Paris deal - in which nearly 200 nations have pledged
to limit global temperatures to a 2C (3.6F) increase on the pre-industrial era -
the actions of the US president, most recently at the G7 meeting in Sicily, have
begun to provoke murmurs that perhaps the world would be better without American
involvement.

say

The final G7 communique saw the US unusually break with the other six nations by
failing to commit itself to the Paris agreement, which Trump promised to
"cancel" during the presidential campaign, and reports on Wednesday claimed he
had decided to exit. The exasperation of European leaders suggested they are
ready to move on with or without the world's second largest emitter of
greenhouse gases.

"The whole discussion about climate has been difficult, or rather very
unsatisfactory," said German chancellor Angela Merkel. "Here we have the
situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand
against one."

The US formally turning its back on perhaps the last best chance of a
coordinated response to climate change would certainly carry heft. Frantic
calculations by several thinkthanks and universities have estimated that US
withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
every year, raising the global temperature by 0.1C (0.2F) to 0.3C (0.5F) by the
end of the century.

Such a regression would be compounded if other countries took the United States'
lead and also decided to quit Paris, or at least not strive to fill the void in
emissions reduction. This would have grave implications for coastal cities
facing sea-level rise, parts of the world already blighted by heatwaves and food
insecurity, and the planet's endangered species.

While US emissions would start to level off rather than continue their gradual
decline, there are signs that India and China, the two other national heavy
hitters in emissions, are moving away from coal more quickly than expected,
according to Climate Action Tracker.

This has led several economists and large US businesses to fret that the coming
boom in solar, wind and other renewable energies will not take place in the US.
China signaled its intent earlier this year by announcing it will invest $360bn
in renewable energy by 2020, creating more than 13m jobs in the sector.

If the economic fallout of leaving the Paris deal does not sway Trump, the
diplomatic and security ramifications may. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of
state, has urged the US to "keep a seat at the table" in order to maintain its
international standing, while UN secretary-general António Guterres has raised
the possibility of "risks of conflict" if climate change is not properly
addressed.

If Trump does decide to stay in the deal, it is likely he will attempt to
"renegotiate" it, which would mainly involve the US revising down its goal of
reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. Opponents of the
deal, such as Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency
chief Scott Pruitt, have framed Paris as a "bad deal" for the US that may even
hinder Trump's domestic agenda of winding back various environmental
regulations.

Several independent legal experts, as well as those who helped craft the Paris
agreement, reject this view, pointing out that the edifice is built on a series
of voluntary non-binding goals submitted by countries. Paris is essentially a
statement of intent, a signal from governments to their citizens and businesses
that low-carbon economies are on the way and that this inevitability should be
financially supported.

Some supporters of Paris are now wondering how useful it would be to have a
disengaged US within such a structure. The American public is largely in favour
of the Paris deal and could be given the misleading impression that their
government is addressing the climate issue by simply staying put, despite
tearing down Barack Obama's climate policies such as the clean power plan at the
same time.

"Wanting the US to remain is a short-sighted, knee-jerk reaction," said Luke
Kemp, an expert in international environmental policy at the Australian National
University. "The international community should be much more worried about the
real domestic actions of the US, rather than whether it is symbolically
cooperating internationally."

Kemp points out that the US could act as a drag upon the international climate
effort if it doesn't leave. "The US and the Trump administration can do more
damage inside the agreement than outside it," he said.

The momentum is reportedly with the "leave" faction, with a group of 22
Republican senators - minus the notable voices of Lindsey Graham and John
McCain, who want the US to remain - urging Trump to make a "clean break" from
Paris. On Tuesday, Trump again met with Pruitt, one of the most vociferous
opponents of the deal.

But the White House's confusion over the decision and its wider ramifications
was perhaps summed up best by Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, who on Tuesday was
asked the simple question of whether Trump believed global warming was spurred
by human activity, a subject he has previously vacillated upon.

"Honestly, I haven't asked him," Spicer replied. "I can get back to you."

HEADLINE: World urges Donald Trump not to dump Paris climate agreement;
World leaders, businesses, scientists and charities join in urging the US
president not to abandon the global accord

BYLINE: Damian Carrington Environment editor

BODY:

World leaders, businesses, investors, scientists and development charities have
joined in urging Donald Trump not to withdraw the US from the Paris climate
change agreement.

The US president is due to announce his decision at 15.00 ET on Thursday and is
expected to pull the world's largest economy, and second greatest polluter, from
the global accord agreed unanimously by almost 200 nations in 2015.

The agreement to fight global warming is based on voluntary pledges to cut
greenhouse emissions but Trump has argued this could damage the US economy.
However, a huge range of US business leaders argue the opposite, saying that the
fast growing green economy is an opportunity for the US.

Twenty-five leading companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Levi Strauss
and Unilever, are running an advert in the US media on Thursday, urging Trump
not to abandon the Paris deal. They say the accord's "stable and practical
framework" creates jobs and is good for business.

step away

Over 1,000 other US companies and investors, including DuPont, eBay and Nike,
have also backed the Paris deal, saying: "Failure to build a low-carbon economy
puts American prosperity at risk." Tesla boss Elon Musk said he had urged Trump
to back Paris and would resign from two presidential advisory bodies he serves
on.

World leaders also stated their commitment to the Paris deal, with China's
premier Li Keqiang saying on Thursday that fighting climate change is a "global
consensus" and an "international responsibility". The EU and China have forged a
new alliance on climate change, stating on Wednesday that the Paris deal had
their "highest political commitment".

Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, tweeted at Trump on
Thursday, asking him: "Please don't change the (political) climate for the
worse." Trump was isolated on the climate issue at a recent G7 summit in Italy.

Malcolm Turnbull, prime minister of Australia, which has in the past opposed
climate action, said the country would remain steadfast in its support for the
Paris agreement. Russia has also reportedly said that it attaches "great
significance" to the Paris deal. On Tuesday, the UN secretary general, António
Guterres, warned if Trump withdraws from the Paris deal, there could be negative
economic, security and societal consequences for the US.

Trump's own secretary of state Rex Tillerson has said the US should remain in
the Paris accord, as has the man who replaced him as CEO of oil giant
ExxonMobil. Another key Trump adviser, Gary Cohn, director of the White House
National Economic Council, noted recently the large rise in renewable energy in
the US: "If you think about how much solar and how much wind power we've created
in the US, we can be a manufacturing powerhouse and still be environmentally
friendly."

Development NGOs warned that a US withdrawal from the Paris agreement would harm
those in poor countries who had contributed least to the problem.

"This will have very serious consequences for millions around the world, whose
lives are on the line because of climate change," said Heather Coleman, from
Oxfam America. "Pulling out of the Paris agreement [would be] a huge
embarrassment that puts the US in the same camp as Nicaragua and Syria - the
only two states who are not party to the agreement."

Scientists have also joined calls for the US to remain, with Prof Gabi Hegerl,
at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, saying: "We know that to limit
warming and the impacts it causes, we need to limit the total amount of carbon
added to the atmosphere. This can only be done if the world economies work
together. If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our
children."

If Trump does pull the US from the Paris deal, US city mayors have said they
will abide by it nonetheless. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said on
Twitter: "The president withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would be horribly
destructive for the planet, the country, and this city. He should know that
climate change is a dagger aimed straight at the heart of New York City."

The mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, who chairs a group of 40 major global cities,
said: "No matter what decision is made by the White House, cities are honouring
their responsibilities to implement the Paris Agreement. There is no alternative
for the future of our planet"

Analysts have warned that a US withdrawal could see carbon taxes placed on US
exports in the future. Richard Black, director of the UK's Energy and Climate
Intelligence Unit, said: "A pullout would widen the diplomatic rift with Europe
that emerged at the G7 summit and could even lead to trade barriers being
erected against US exports."

There are few voices supporting Trump but Danish scientist Bjørn Lomborg said:
"The carbon-cutting treaty approach has failed politically and economically for
two decades. It is an incredibly expensive distraction from the green energy R&D
investment that is needed to solve climate change."

In Australia, Craig Kelly, the Liberal party chair of the parliament's
environment committee, backed US withdrawal: "It's not confirmed yet but we have
the champagne on ice."

HEADLINE: US would join Syria and Nicaragua on climate accord 'no' list;
Only other UN members not party to Paris agreement never signed up, but for
reasons of war and principle, not disbelief

BYLINE: Haroon Siddique

BODY:

Assuming the US does, as expected, pull out of the historic Paris agreement on
climate change, it will join a very small list of countries with which it has
little else in common in terms of emissions.

The only other UN members not signed up are Nicaragua and Syria, which both
chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place.

Their reasons for doing so were very different from those which seem to be
influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax.

Nicaragua' declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far
enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua's lead envoy to the Paris
negotiations, told Climate Home : "We're not going to submit because voluntary
responsibility is a path to failure. We don't want to be an accomplice to taking
the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents."

The Bonn-based UN climate body has requested all countries in a position to do
so to submit "intended nationally determined contributions" (INDCs) to
international efforts to hold warming to 2C.

The following month, he told Democracy Now : "Universal responsibility -
everyone is responsible - is a spin on historical responsibility, because
everyone didn't create this problem". The country's share of global emissions
(0.03%) pales beside that of the US (13.19%), yet it came fourth on a list of
countries most affected by climate change between 1996 and 2015, according to
the Global Climate Risk Index.

For its part, Syria has been mired in a civil war since 2011. The government of
Bashar al-Assad has been heavily sanctioned by the UN over human rights
violations, making it a pariah to much of the international community. The
sanctions would have made it difficult for members of the Syrian government to
travel to Paris to attend the discussions, and the ongoing conflict would have
made it difficult for it to commit to any limitation of the country's emissions.

Nevertheless, other countries in the midst of conflict have signed up, including
Yemen, as well other countries isolated by the international community, such as
North Korea. Syria's share of global emissions is also low compared with the US,
at 0.14%.

HEADLINE: The Republicans who urged Trump to pull out of Paris deal are big oil
darlings;
Twenty-two senators wrote a letter to the president when he was said to be on
the fence about backing out. They received more than $10m from oil, gas and coal
companies the past three election cycles

BYLINE: Tom McCarthy in New York and Lauren Gambino in Washington

BODY:

A withdrawal by Donald Trump from the Paris climate accord would go down as a
hallmark of his presidency. It would be unilateral, reckless and splashy -
trademark Trump.

But while Trump has often stood on a range of issues as a maverick outlier from
mainstream Republican politics, on climate change he is at the centre of the
party's orthodoxy. Trump's disbelief in climate change and imminent decision on
whether to support the Paris agreement reflects an area of unusual agreement
between the president and elected Republicans, whose track record of climate
change denialism is plain and long.

without US

Unmissable behind the elected Republicans stand other interests: the oil, gas
and coal industries, which together are some of the most influential donors to
Republican candidates.

The big-money supporters got a return on their investment last week, when 22
Republican senators whose campaigns have collected more than $10m in oil, gas
and coal money since 2012 sent a letter from the president urging him to
withdraw from the Paris deal.

Trump had been said to be on the fence about the deal. Members of his inner
circle, including his daughter, were reported to favor staying in.

"We strongly encourage you to make a clean break from the Paris Agreement," read
the letter, drafted by Wyoming's John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate committee
on environment and public works, and Oklahoma's Jim Inhofe, a longtime climate
change denier and senior member of that committee.

The letter argued that the Paris deal threatened Tru mp's efforts to rescind the
clean power plan, an Obama-era set of regulations and guidelines that include
emissions caps and other rules deemed onerous by the fossil fuel industries.

It was not as if Trump wanted for advisers urging him to withdraw from the Paris
deal even before the letter was sent. Environmental Protection Agency
administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Stephen Bannon urged withdrawal,
while energy secretary Rick Perry favored renegotiation.

Public opposition to the deal from almost two dozen senators just as the
president prepared to make his decision, however, demonstrated the extent to
which the opponents of the Paris were organized, ready to strike and to offer
important political cover if Trump pulls the US out of the historic global deal.

Donations from oil, gas and coal interests to the signatories of the letter are
Open Secrets that seemed ready for a new review. A Guardian survey of Federal
Elections Commission data organized by the Center for Responsive Politics found
that the industries gave a total of $10,694,284 to the 22 senators over the past
three election cycles.

Visible donations to Republicans from those industries exceeded donations to
Democrats in the 2016 election cycle by a ratio of 15-to-1, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics. And that does not include so-called dark money
passed from oil interests such as Koch industries to general slush funds to
re-elect Republicans such as the Senate leadership fund.

At least $90m in untraceable money has been funneled to Republican candidates
from oil, gas and coal interests in the past three election cycles, according to
Federal Election Commission disclosures analyzed by the Center for Responsive
Politics.

HEADLINE: Barnaby Joyce refuses to say if Australia should support Paris climate
deal if US quits;
Deputy PM departs from official Coalition line, saying 'to speculate on what
Donald Trump might do is insanity' and I'm going to 'see what happens'

BYLINE: Katharine Murphy Political editor

BODY:

Barnaby Joyce has declined to say whether Australia should remain within the
Paris climate accord if the United States pulls out, in a departure from the
official government line that Australia will stay the course.

While Australia's energy and employment ministers have said this week Australia
will honour its Paris commitments regardless of what Donald Trump decides, the
Nationals leader and deputy prime minister was more guarded on Thursday.

Asked what Australia should do if Trump quit the treaty, Joyce told reporters:
"Well, um, to speculate on a whole range of things is dangerous, to speculate on
what Donald Trump might do is insanity."

Related:  Michaelia Cash says Donald Trump should keep US in Paris climate deal

Pressed with a second question, Joyce said: "I'm going to watch my Twitter feed
and see what happens."

The US president confirmed on Thursday morning Australian time the formal
decision of his administration about Paris was imminent.

I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The
White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!- Donald J. Trump
(@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017

Over this past weekend, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg,
repeated previous statements by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that
Australia was in the Paris accord for the long haul.

The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, during an appearance before Senate
estimates on Wednesday, said the government had made it clear that the US
staying the course with the global climate agreement was desirable and in
Australia's national interest.

She said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and to our carbon
emissions reduction target, and she said Australia's interests were best served
by the US maintaining its commitment to the Paris agreement.

Frydenberg said on Wednesday afternoon what Trump did was a matter for him but
he noted the emissions intensity of the US economy was at its lowest level in 20
years. "It is moving in the right direction," he said.

He said more than 140 countries had ratified the Paris agreement and "Australia
takes our obligations to agreements we sign up to and ratify very seriously.

"Australia has commitments and we are sticking to those. I think we can meet our
targets and we are making good progress in doing so."

On Thursday, Malcolm Turnbull was asked whether history would repeat itself.
Turnbull was asked whether he would follow Trump out of Paris, just as John
Howard had followed George W Bush out of the Kyoto treaty.

Turnbull said Australia was staying in the agreement. "I repeat today, what I
said on the 16th of November, when the treaty was ratified, when Australia makes
a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through and that's exactly what
we're doing."

"We are committed to the Paris agreement, and we're on track to meet our
targets."

In a television interview later on Thursday, Joyce also indicated Australia
would stay the course. "The whole point of having international agreements is
you comply with them," the deputy prime minister told Sky News.

Joyce said Australia would comply with the Paris agreement in a way that would
have a "minimal impact" on the job prospects of Australians.

But government conservatives have been signalling for months that Australia
should review its commitments if Trump quits the treaty.

The chairman of the government's backbench committee on environment and energy,
Craig Kelly, told Guardian Australia on Thursday if the US pulled out, Australia
would need to consider its position.

politics live

"I think we should reconsider where the entire treaty is up to," Kelly said.

The Sydney Liberal said Australia's commitment under the agreement was "one of
the most significant in the world" and he contrasted that commitment with
undertakings from China and Russia, which he characterised as negligible.

He said the Paris treaty weakened America economically at the expense of two
strategic adversaries, China and Russia. "Is that a good thing from Australia's
point of view?"

Kelly said if Trump chose to stay within the Paris framework, but scale back the
US emissions reduction commitments, then Australia could follow suit.

As reports emerged from the US that Trump would likely pull out, Kelly posted on
Facebook that he had "the champagne on ice".

Kelly's view will be shared by other conservatives. While he is yet to enter the
fray on the Paris deal, Tony Abbott has been campaigning publicly against the
renewable energy target he adjusted as prime minister for some months.

The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed
Seselja, one of the government's up-and-coming conservative figures, said last
month Australia was already "doing more than our share, in my opinion".

The frontbencher said Australia was committed to the Paris treaty as things
stood, but if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement.
"Obviously you wouldn't want to speculate, but if they were to pull out
obviously that would change the nature of that agreement."

Trump's likely withdrawal from the Paris deal complicates the politics of energy
policy for the Turnbull government, which next week will be handed the Finkel
review of the national electricity market.

In a speech to an economic thinktank late on Wednesday, Frydenberg referenced
the climate wars of the past decade, noting that energy policy had "destroyed
two prime ministers and one opposition leader".

He predicted "big battles" both within the Coalition - and potentially within
Labor - and externally with stakeholders, as the government seeks to land a new
policy post-Finkel.

There a widespread expectation among key industry groups that the chief
scientist will use his looming report to recommend the government adopt a new
low-emissions target, which would work in practice as a technology-neutral
renewable energy target (RET).

HEADLINE: Great Barrier Reef sharply declines in north but signs coral
recovering elsewhere;
Australian Institute of Marine Science says reef's capacity to recover under
threat from climate change and pollution

BYLINE: Michael Slezak

BODY:

Parts of the Great Barrier Reef not regularly affected by problems such as
cyclones have demonstrated the reef still has the ability to regenerate, with a
survey showing sharp declines in coral cover in the north but increases
elsewhere.

However, the latest results from the Australian Institute of Marine Science
(Aims), collected by divers visiting 243 individual reefs, do not include the
losses caused by bleaching this year, or the effects of cyclone Debbie, both of
which killed coral in the central section.

Up until March 2017, the results show that coral cover over the whole Great
Barrier Reef improved dramatically between 2012 and 2016 but then suffered an
unprecedented loss from the 2016 bleaching, with about a quarter of the reef's
coral being killed.

The head of the long-term monitoring program at Aims, Hugh Sweatman, said the
capacity of the reef to recover was under threat from climate change, as well as
other chronic stressors such as pollution.

"The predictions under climate change are that cyclones will get more intense,
which means there will be more damage, so they will require longer to recover,"
Sweatman said. In addition, pollution and warmer waters are slowing the rate of
recovery.

Related:  The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare

"So you've got this double whammy. The time for recovery is likely to get less
and the rate of recovery is going to be impeded.

"So what I'm saying is it's OK so far but there are limits to this."

Sweatman also noted the recovery in the southern section of the Great Barrier
Reef was partly a result of those reefs being mostly dominated by fast-growing
corals, which are easily damaged by cyclones but recover relatively quickly.

Richard Leck, a campaigner at WWF, said the results gave hope to
conservationists.

"There is still resilience in the system," Leck said. "This data shows that if
the reefs aren't exposed to underwater heatwaves, if they're not subject to
major pollution events, and they're not hit by a cyclone, then they recover
really well and that should give us a lot of hope that the resilience of the
Great Barrier Reef is still there and, if we reduce those threats, we should see
recovery reef-wide."

That loss as a result of the 2016 bleaching event was driven almost entirely by
coral mortality in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef, where there was
ongoing loss since 2013 caused by two cyclones and the continuing
crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak.

As a result, the northern Great Barrier Reef has lost the majority of its coral,
declining from about 25% coral cover in 2010 to just 10%. "This level of decline
is unprecedented in the 30+ year time series," the report said.

While coral cover in the central section declined to a record low in 2012,
following massive damage from tropical cyclone Yasi in 2011, since then coral
cover has increased to levels not seen since the mid 1980s.

But even that upward trajectory was reversed in 2016 when bleaching and
crown-of-thorns activity caused significant mortality there.

Sweatman said next year's results will likely reveal even more significant coral
loss in that region, following the most recent bleaching and cyclone Debbie.

In the southern section of the Great Barrier Reef, the latest results show
continued improvement in coral cover. In that region, coral cover had reduced
from almost 45% coverage in the mid-1980s, to below 10% in 2011. The latest
results show coral cover has continued to recover, to more than 30%.

The report notes that impacts from the latest bleaching will be captured in
future Aims long-term monitoring program updates.

Imogen Zethoven, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said it was
"heartening to see coral cover increase significantly in the southern third of
the Great Barrier Reef".

"It's not too late to save our reef but the federal government must stop the
Adani coalmine, reject all new coalmines and switch to 100% renewable energy as
a matter of urgency," Zethoven said.

Intensive farming cited as main reason for destroying natural barriers to deluge
and making low lying areas more vulnerable to floods

BYLINE: Fiona Harvey, environment correspondent

BODY:

Only a tenth of England's extensive floodplains are now fit for purpose - 90% no
longer function properly - with the shortfall putting an increasing number of
homes and businesses at risk of flooding, according to a new report.

Floods are more likely due to climate change and will claim higher economic
costs unless action is taken to halt the damage to floodplains and restore some
of their functions, warned the authors of the 12-month study - the first to
paint a comprehensive view of England's floodplains and their capabilities. "We
have ignored our floodplains," said George Heritage of Salford University,
co-author of the study the Changing Face of Floodplains, published by Co-Op
Insurance on Thursday. "The changes to them mean water [from heavy rainfall] can
flow much faster downstream, and can flow at the same speed as the water in the
rivers." This accelerated flow has led to sudden and unstoppable deluges in
recent years. For instance, Storm Desmond in 2015 affected more than 6,000 homes
as rivers and streams burst their banks and spread water over floodplains. As
these natural floodplains had been altered by man-made features, they no longer
had the ability to store water, leading to rapid flows into urban areas which
led to the devastation. Storm Desmond caused more than £500m in damages, and
misery for families excluded from their homes sometimes for months. The UK's
flooding bills are on the rise, with scientists warning of rocketing numbers of
cloudbursts and periods of sudden and intense rainfall as climate change takes
effect. Floodplains act as natural "sponges", soaking up excess water in their
vegetation, forming natural buffers that hold back or divert rushing water after
rain, and providing areas where rivers can breach their banks and wetlands can
be replenished.

Intensive agriculture, increasing urbanisation, poor management of rivers and
the draining of wetlands have left the vast majority of these natural features -
many previously preserved for centuries by communities who understood their
value - unable to fulfil these valuable functions, with some close to collapse.
Building on floodplains has been singled out for years as a key problem, but
perhaps surprisingly was found to contribute only about a tenth of the damage in
the study. Far greater is intensive farming, which has created artificially
"smooth" and uniform landscapes, with hedgerows removed, large areas given over
to single crops, wetlands drained and woods and grassland diminished. Farming
accounts for nearly two-thirds of the loss of functioning floodplains, according
to the study. Natural floodplains cover about 5% of England, from upland areas
and tablelands to low-lying marshes, such as the Somerset levels and the East
Anglian fens. Once they were used for grazing for parts of the year, or left
uncultivated. However, the exploitation of such areas accelerated in the middle
of the last century, when wetlands were drained, hedgerows grubbed up and small
farms gave way to bigger farming enterprises. Today, the report found, 90% of
England's floodplains no longer function properly, with 65% modified by
agriculture "meaning they're now man-made, smoother surfaces"; 9% lost to urban
and suburban building developments; 4% are now occupied by open water and 6% by
semi-natural woodland and rough grassland; and only 0.5% is now natural or
semi-natural wetland. "It would be almost impossible to return the altered areas
to their original state," noted Heritage. "But it is possible to work with
farmers to introduce features that would allow them to function better." These
can include restoring hedgerows, which act as a brake on surface water, in place
of wire fences or missing field barriers helps, as does keeping or replanting
natural vegetation, and encouraging mixed use rather than uniform monoculture.
These methods can also benefit farmers, by retaining topsoil that is easily
washed away by flooding.

Good management is also essential: for instance, big trees growing near rivers
can exacerbate flood damage, because they can fall into rivers. Traditional
methods of pollarding trees result in smaller but stouter growth and more stable
root structures, providing more robust river banks that can resist breaking. "We
would definitely see economic benefits," from these changes, said Heritage. Even
small gains can be significant: Heritage said research had found floodplain
restoration efforts could slow the speed of water flow by 10-15%, which may be
enough to give vital breathing space for downstream communities as they cope
with the impact of river flooding. Martin Rogers, flood management adviser at
the National Farmers' Union, which assisted with the response to Storm Desmond,
said: "Farmers are happy to play their role to reduce flood risk [in Cumbria].
However, natural flood management is not the only solution and we believe should
only be used as part of a cohesive package of measures across the catchment.
Where farmers provide a service in mitigating flood risk to help protect others,
this must be part of a clear, planned strategy." Caroline Russell, the Green
Party candidate challenging Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in his Islington North
constituency, said taxpayer payments to farmers should depend on providing such
services.

"Farming subsidies should be used to make sure land is used to store water. We
have completely messed up our floodplains, we are getting more water from
climate change, and there is nowhere for the water to go. Land in the
countryside has to work differently to protect the built-up areas from
flooding," she told the Greener UK Hustings conference on Tuesday in London.
Flooding, along with other environmental issues, has received little attention
in most areas during the general election campaign. The Environment Agency runs
an online service allowing people to sign up to receive any flood warnings in
their areas, and other basic advice includes putting aside emergency equipment
such as torches and batteries, candles and matches, as well as non-perishable
food and waterproof clothing.

Drawing up a "flood plan" is also advised, setting out actions including moving
pets to safety, looking out for neighbours, taking treasured possessions
upstairs, filling baths, sinks and containers with tapwater in case clean water
supplies are shut down, and charging mobile phones immediately a warning is
received.

HEADLINE: Salmon crisis is all man's fault

BYLINE: davidmccann

BODY:

THE number of wild salmon that die returning to the rivers in which they spawned
could be halved if  all the threats that man controls were managed or removed,
say scientists.

Experts have been trying to explain why, 20 years ago, one in four smolts
leaving their rivers in the UK would return every year as adult salmon to spawn
and further the development of the species. Today, as few as one in 20 will come
back.

The catastrophic collapse in salmon stocks has long been  attributed to climate
change, with conservationists insisting little can be done unless global warming
is reversed.

However, the Atlantic Salmon Trust, based in Edinburgh, said up to twice as many
fish would survive the epic annual journey to and from the ocean if the perils
they faced were reduced.

The public has been largely shielded from the effects of the collapse because of
the rise of salmon farming.

Ken Whelan, the trust's research director, said: "It's like a relay race with
hurdles and it depends how many of the hurdles we can take down.

"The number of post-smolts declines due to cumulative effects of natural
mortality as well as any man-made influences, such as  fishing mortality in the
form of by-catch." Young salmon are at risk from river pollution caused by
industry, forestry and agricultural run-off. If water levels are low  or the
rivers are blocked by weirs they face delays that leave them  vulnerable to
predators such as cormorants and goosanders. If they swim past a salmon farm
they risk a swarm of sea lice.

In the estuaries, they must run the gauntlet of seals, whose populations have
increased 500 per cent since 1978.

At sea they must navigate  thousands of miles amid changing stocks of bait fish
and plankton, on which they feed, steering clear of mackerel and herring nets
spread by trawlers.

Mr Whelan said: "The lesson  we must learn is that man's  influence can and does
have an impact on these struggling populations.

"Management actions have historically taken place in fresh- water but the
emphasis is now moving to the coastal zone and the open ocean."

HEADLINE: US to quit climate accord

BYLINE: By Julie Pace, in Washington

BODY:

DONALD Trump is expected to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord,
according to a White House official.

But the official said there may be "caveats in the language" the president uses
to announce the withdrawal, leaving open the possibility that the decision is
not final.

Nearly 200 nations, including the US, agreed in 2015 to voluntarily reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change.

During Mr Trump's overseas trip last week, European leaders pressed him to keep
the US in the landmark agreement. He had promised during his presidential
campaign to pull the US out of the deal.

Mr Trump, who has called global warming a "hoax", tweeted: "I will be announcing
my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN!"

Withdrawing would leave the US aligned only with Russia among the world's
industrialised economies in rejecting action to combat climate change.

Word of Mr Trump's decision comes a day after he met Scott Pruitt, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Like his boss, Mr Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that
the Earth is warming and that man-made climate emissions are to blame. Since
taking office, the pair have moved to delay or roll back federal regulations
limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive US coal mines.

What is not yet clear is whether Mr Trump plans to initiate a formal withdrawal
from the Paris accord, which under the terms of the agreement could take three
years, or exit the underlying UN climate change treaty on which the accord was
based.

The US is the world's second largest emitter of carbon, following only China.
Beijing, however, has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting its targets under the
Paris accord, recently cancelling construction of about 100 coal-fired power
plants and investing billions in massive wind and solar projects.

The news from the White House led to a swift and strong reaction from the United
Nations. The UN's main Twitter page quotes secretary-general Antonio Guterres as
saying: "Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate
solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable."

The post includes a link to an impassioned speech Mr Guterres gave on Tuesday
when he called on the world to intensify action to combat climate change.

He said: "It would be very important for the US not to leave the Paris
agreement."

HEADLINE: Europe has got its mojo back - thanks to Brexit and Trump;
BRUSSELS Fractures with UK and US create a new unity. By Leo Cendrowicz

BYLINE: Leo Cendrowicz

BODY:

There is a surprising cheer spreading through the bars in the Brussels European
quarter. The mood has changed. The smiles are back. Europe, people are
muttering, has found its mojo again. And it is largely thanks to two unlikely
sources: Donald Trump and Brexit.

Mr Trump was in Brussels last week meeting with Nato and EU leaders. It might
have been a moment to reassure his allies and reassert essential transatlantic
values. But instead, he berated Nato members over defence spending, failed to
endorse Nato's Article 5, guaranteeing mutual defence, and ignored pleas to
stick with the 2015 Paris climate change treaty.

His public displays were just as ghastly, as he seemed to revel in bullying and
boorishness that not only disgusted Europeans but made them newly proud of each
other.

Meanwhile, as Britain has been preparing its exit from the EU, most Europeans
have watched with a sense of morbid curiosity. If there were fears last year
that other member states might follow the British out the door, they are long
gone.

Viewed from the EU, the Brexit process looks woefully chaotic for Theresa May:
her ministers seem unready, her officials underresourced, and her negotiating
hand weak; and EU leaders think Britain is heading for a future that will see it
poorer and smaller.

To the surprise even of Brussels officials, the other 27 EU members have stayed
remarkably cohesive in facing Britain. They have moved on from the shock of
Brexit: they regret the result but accept it. And now their priority is the
unity and integrity of the EU-27.

Together, Mr Trump and Brexit have been the EU's perfect recruiting sergeants.
The timing is working out for the EU too. The election of Emmanuel Macron as
French President has been a massive relief for the rest of Europe, and seems to
signal a retreat for the populist surge. Mr Macron is an economic and social
liberal, proud to parade his European credentials, and keen to revive the bloc,
notably by relaunching the Franco-German motor of integration.

In his first weeks as President, he has projected an image as a bold and brassy
leader, unafraid to stand up to Mr Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. His ascent
opens a window of opportunity for Berlin and Paris to draw up a blueprint to
reform the eurozone, and perhaps even create a European defence union. Mr Macron
could well become the poster boy for the EU's renewal, though that's not to say
his ideas for renewal and financial management will necessarily coincide with
that of Germany's hawkish finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble.

But the EU's economy is finally showing some signs of revival after almost a
decade in the doldrums. The European Commission hiked its spring economic
forecasts in early May, saying the 19-nation eurozone will grow 1.7 per cent
this year.

On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel went as far as saying that Europe can
no longer depend on either Britain or the US in future, and "that we Europeans
truly have to take our fate into our own hands".

Of course, this new spring in Brussels has not untangled the EU's many messy
political thorn bushes. The Greek euro crisis is still rumbling on. The growth
spurts are tentative. Eastern European members such as Hungary and Poland are
drifting into authoritarianism. The refugee crisis that almost paralysed the EU
two years ago could rear up again.

But the signs are that the EU has turned a corner. There is a new feeling of
confidence and solidarity that might have been unthinkable at the end of 2016
And to EU eyes, at least, Mr Trump and Brexit are sending a mighty message about
why Europe matters.

The other 27 EU members have moved on from the shock of Brexit: they regret the
result but accept it

HEADLINE: Coral vs coal: the environmental battle that divides Australia;
AUSTRALIA A massive mine project raises fears for the Great Barrier Reef's
future. By Rod McGuirk

BYLINE: Rod McGuirk

BODY:

As many Australians grapple with how to save their Great Barrier Reef from
global warming, others are preoccupied with building one of the world's biggest
coal mines nearby.

Green campaigners say burning more coal would increase climate change and
further damage coral that is already dying, owing to rising sea temperatures.
However, coal mining and environmental tourism are both cash cows for the state
of Queensland, a resource-rich north-east playground that promotes itself as
Australia's "Sunshine State".

The Carmichael coal project, a massive £13bn mine in the remote Galilee Basin
that Indian resource billionaire Gautam Adani hopes to start work on this year,
has created an extraordinary clash between the resource and environment sectors.
Those concerned by the environmental cost of the colossal development are
particularly irked that federal and state governments have considered
subsidising Mr Adani's entry into an already crowded Australian industry.

Mr Adani boasts that the mine will generate power for 100 million Indians, while
providing Queensland with 10,000 jobs, plus £13bn in mining tax and royalties
within 30 years.

"This will assist much-needed public funding to help deliver schools, hospitals,
roads and other services and stimulating activity throughout the economy," he
said.

A study of coral bleaching on the reef, published in the journal Nature in
March, suggested that rising ocean temperatures off Australia's coast was to
blame for the fact that 91 per cent of the 1,400-mile Great Barrier Reef had
been bleached at least once during the past two decades, with the most serious
event occurring last year.

The government authority in charge of the reef marine park reported to a Senate
committee in May that as much as half of the 133,000 square miles of coral might
already be dead due to bleaching.

"This has happened because of global warming. We burned too many fossil fuels
and might have lost half the reef," said Sam Regester, campaign director of the
activist organisation GetUp.

Some are concerned that the Adani mine will further damage the World
Heritage-listed reef, through dredging at its port at Abbot Point at the south
end of the coral, dust contamination of its waters or through increased
coal-carrier traffic, with all its inherent risks.

Opponents argue that the main threat to the reef isn't posed by the mine's
proximity. They blame the sheer mass of warming carbon gases that it could
unleash.

Burning all the coal in the Galilee Basin would release an estimated 705 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide each year - more than 1.3 times Australia's
current annual emissions from all sources. AP

HEADLINE: Trump close to pulling out of climate deal;
ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: Ian Johnston

BODY:

Donald Trump is ready to withdraw the United States from supporting the Paris
Agreement on climate change, White House sources have claimed.

The US is currently one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world,
so if President Trump was to pull the country out the landmark pact to reduce
such carbon emissions it would be a major blow to a deal that aims to help avert
the worst effects of climate change.

Following a number of reports about the move, Mr Trump tweeted that he would be
announcing "my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days" followed by
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" The Axios news website said the sources had "direct
knowledge of the decision" made by the Republican billionaire, who has
previously described global warming as a hoax perpetrated by China.

Mr Trump can withdraw from Paris on his own authority. The reason it was called
an "agreement'" was to enable Barack Obama to use the president's executive
power to ratify it without having to seek the permission of Congress, which must
ratify any international treaties. The decision to withdraw from the climate
accord was influenced by a letter from 22 Republican senators, Axios reported.
Mr Trump has ignored the advice of a string of senior advisers, including his
daughter Ivanka, Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson, who all advocated keeping a seat at the table.

Mr Mattis and others in the Department of Defence have noted that the Pentagon
does a substantial amount of work addressing rising sea levels, changing sea
routes for warships due to melting glaciers.

During his campaign, Mr Trump had vowed to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100
days of becoming president, as part of an effort to bolster US oil and coal
industries.

So far the world's average temperature has risen by just under one degree
because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.

Supporters of the climate pact are concerned that a US exit could lead other
nations to weaken their commitments or also withdraw, softening an accord that
scientists have said is critical to avoiding the worst impacts of climate
change.

THE INDEPENDENT Pope Francis tried to influence the president during his recent
visit to the Vatican by presenting him with a papal letter written in 2015
regarding the need to address the issue of climate change.

HEADLINE: Chemicals industry must play its part in lowering carbon emissions -
DSM

BODY:

Interview article by Will Beacham

BARCELONA (ICIS)--DSM has become something of a sustainability trailblazer for
the chemical industry as it pushes the concept of carbon pricing through its own
operations and investments, as well as lobbying others to do so.

The Dutch specialty group applies a €50/tonne carbon price to all its operations
and investments as part of a company growth strategy which is driven by trends
of global population growth and the need for action against climate change.

Management board and executive committee member, Dmitri de Vreeze, who is
responsible for the company's Materials division plus sourcing, the Netherlands
and Asia, says that since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, industry must
play its part in pursuing the target of keeping global temperature rises less
than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

"That can only work with intervention and we want to show our commitment to
this. Some businesses will be scared and this should be the case for those with
very high carbon emissions - these companies should take action.

He adds: "We feel governments and legislators need to help businesses take a
step up in improving the world."

DSM's €50/tonne carbon price assumption is used to judge the viability of
existing operations and future investments. "We measure our own carbon footprint
and that of any new investments and this helps us future-proof our businesses.
We think this should be implemented [more widely] and we feel it will come," de
Vreeze adds.

DSM emits 1.5m tonnes/year of carbon. All of its sites are analysed with the aim
of cutting their emissions by 3-4% each year. The company's carbon emissions
have declined by 40-45% since 2008. "We must look at all sites and the worst
performers need huge programmes to cut their emissions," he says.

DSM also takes part in carbon price lobbying. CEO Feike Sijbesma is on the
Global Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition which encourages other companies to
work with a carbon price.

The coalition brings together 200 executives from government, the private sector
and civil society to share experience working with carbon pricing and to expand
the evidence base for the most effective carbon pricing systems and policies.

"A few countries do it such as China which is taking a huge leadership role. A
level playing field is important as there are different systems in Europe, China
and Canada that should be aligned."

According to Judith Schroeter, business director Carbon Market Analytics for
ICIS, internal carbon pricing is becoming more common, mainly in reaction to the
Paris agreement on climate change that was signed in 2015.

She is aware of its use by international oil and gas companies and several
consultancies supporting other industrial companies in setting up internal
carbon prices.

Businesses are required to take part in different carbon markets if they operate
in several regions, so "it makes it internally easier for companies if they are
using a constant price across the business."

RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGETS

DSM has joined RE100, a global business initiative committed to 100% renewable
electricity. The company has a RE100 goal to purchase 100% renewable
electricity, with an interim target that 50% of purchased electricity will be
from renewable sources by 2025.

DSM is working with AkzoNobel, Google and Dutch electronics/healthcare group
Philips to invest in the Krammer wind park in the Netherlands. This will start
up in 2019 and generate 350,000,000 kWh of power, or enough for 100,000
households. DSM will purchase enough to provide 10% of its total annual
electricity needs.

"DSM is always being future-proofed. We go out to the market and pick out trends
over the next 5-10 years. We see two big macro trends, firstly the growth in
global population from 7.6bn-9.7bn by 2050: this raises a food and nutrition
problem that will drive growth."

He adds: "Looking at these trends we will build the new DSM for the future. Our
strategy is built around sustainability. The world expects companies and
governments to be more focussed on sustainable business."

De Vreeze concedes that his materials division has a worse carbon footprint than
others, but points out that many of its products such as engineering plastics
substitute metal to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) through light-weighting and fuel
efficiency.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES IMPACT

Electric motors produce a lot less heat than internal combustion engines so have
less requirement for high heat-resistant materials such as nylon 6 and 6,6.

De Vreeze agrees, but adds that some trends in the electric vehicle market are
positive for DSM, and some negative. He believes electric vehicles will be an
important market but not mainstream for another 20 years.

"At that point high heat-resistant engineering plastics will perhaps be less
relevant. But there will be an increase in the need for other materials [such as
engineering plastics] for friction reduction as well as films in batteries."

Increasing the distance between charges through weight reduction will be a key
priority and this will drive different forms of innovation with more new raw
materials. He highlights polyamides, caprolactam, and new composites like
Dyneema, which DSM claims is the world's strongest fibre.

"The next step is the internal combustion engine over the next 10 years - making
them more efficient. Then electric vehicles will be the following step up in
10-20 years."

He says DSM's innovation pipeline will switch to different systems in terms of
materials and there will be a change in where the company sells its products.

"These materials must be sustainable and follow the circular economy in terms of
reuse and recyclability. Bio-based resins and composites will be important."

HEADLINE: IRENA to aid China's grid connect with renewables

BYLINE: Baron Laudermilk

BODY:

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the State Grid Corporation
of China (SGCC) have agreed to improve China's energy transition by improving
grid connections for renewables.

The agreement will help China comply with its part in the Paris Agreement to
reduce carbon emissions, and push forward its One Belt, One Road trade
initiative.

The framework agreed by IRENA and SGCC includes co-working on initiatives to
integrate renewablesintoChina's state power grid,and smart grid projects.

The agreement was signed on the side lines of the of the Eighth Clean Energy
Ministerial in Beijing, China between IRENA director-general Adnan Z. Amin and
SGCC chairman Shu Yinbiao.

State Grid of China, the country's largest utility company, has built 10
cross-border transmission lines, connecting China with neighboring countries
such as Russia and Mongolia.

State Grid of China is about halfway through a plan to spend $88 billion on
UHVDC lines between 2009 and 2020. It wants 23 lines in operation by 2030.

HEADLINE: DONG Energy plots post-summer offshore wind bond

BYLINE: Olivia Gagan

BODY:

DONG Energy is working on a potential bond raise for its 660MW Walney Extension
offshore wind project in the UK, IJGlobal understands.

Sources said the Danish utility has hired Goldman Sachs to structure the deal
and is going through a ratings assessment process ahead of an autumn launch.

Goldman Sachs and DONG Energy declined to comment.

A sales process is ongoing for the project, and sources said the bond raise
could be structured to allow equity partners to come in and co-finance the
project. The Danish sponsor typically sells down 50% stakes in its
in-development offshore wind farms.

In February 2016 it sold a 50% stake in its upcoming &pound;800 million, 258MW
Burbo Bank Extension to Danish pension fund PKA and Lego owner Kirkbifor DKr6.6
billion ($1 billion). In December 2016 it sold 50% of the 573MW Race Bank
offshore wind farmto Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 5 and Macquarie
Capital for &pound;1.6 billion.

DONG Energy made a final investment decision on Walney Extension October 2015
and construction has begun on thewind farm. It will operate under the UK's
Contracts for Difference (CfD) regime, which guarantees an index-linked 15-year
electricity price. The project was amongeight renewables projects to be awarded
early CfD investment contracts in April 2014by the then-Department of Energy and
Climate Change under its final investment decision-enabling scheme.

The initial tariff or 'strike price' was &pound;150/MWh ($194.70). This has
since risen with inflation to &pound;161.71/MWh.

Dong's combined 367.2MWWalney 1 and Walney 2projects off Barrow-in-Furness on
the Cumbria coast entered operation back in early 2012.

Located 19km off the Cumbrian coast in the Irish Sea, Walney Extension is
expected to be fully commissioned in 2019. It will be the biggest offshore wind
farm in the world, overtaking DONG's existing 630MWLondon Arraywind farm which
entered operation in 2014.

HEADLINE: AIIB president: No coal in our pipeline

BYLINE: Mia Tahara-Stubbs

BODY:

The Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Bank (AIIB) has "no coal projects in our
pipeline," president Jin Liquin declared. "And we will not consider any
proposals if we are concerned about their environmental and reputational
impact," he added at the opening ceremony for the bank's second annual board of
governors meeting in Jeju, South Korea.

In addition, chief investment officer Dr. D. J. Pandiandisclosed that China,
which is behind the setting up of the multilateral bank, will not be applying
for loans "for the time being". AIIB also remains committed to the Paris climate
agreement and the bank will focus on connectivity projects, such as ports, rail
and airports, as well as clean power and urban development.

In other AIIB pipeline news, the bank is prepared to lend up to $500 million to
Mumbai Metro Line 4, Pandiansaid. Further down the line, AIIB is planning to
take on credit enhancement capabilities in 2018 and local currency funding
around 2020.

The bank also announced that next year's third board of governors will be held
in Mumbai, India and that it has admitted Argentina, Madagascar and Tonga as new
members, taking the total number of member countries to 80.

Ahead of the meeting, AIIB also announced the approval of its first equity
investment, $150 million in India Infrastructure Fund, as well as two
co-financing loans for projects in Georgia and Tajikistan.

HEADLINE: Inaugural village environment day a success

BYLINE: Claire Lomax

BODY:

ADDINGHAM Civic Society's Environment Group held its first village environment
day to showcase its activities over the last 12 months.

It was also a chance for other groups, both within the village and wider region,
to demonstrate their environmental programmes.

The themes for the day were: Addingham's natural environment, Addingham and the
Neighbourhood Plan, responding to climate change and celebrating Addingham's
environment.

The Memorial Hall was crowded throughout the morning with visitors, including
children who enjoyed the hands-on activities. An afternoon walk was also
attended by more than 30 people taking advantage of the fine weather and expert
commentary to learn about the natural history of the village.

Displays by members of the Environment Group included: Geology (Will Varley);
Butterflies (Diane Morris); Notable Trees (Nicky Vernon and Heather Burrow);
Birds (Harry Jevons, Chris Acomb, David Austin); Solar Panels and Renewable
Energy (Richard Walton and Lizzie Hebbert); a 3-D scale model of the Village
(Don Porritt) and Green Spaces and the Neighbourhood Plan (Jan Hindle).

The Neighbourhood Plan display included a presentation of photographs sent in by
local residents showing their favourite view of the village as well as an
invitation to fill in a questionnaire survey about village green space.
Councillor Adrian Naylor in his welcome address emphasised the importance of the
Neighbourhood Plan in guiding future developments in the village and stressed
the importance of residents taking the opportunity to contribute to it to ensure
environmental issues were fully represented.

Other village organisations represented included the Garden Friends who
highlighted their ecologically sensitive approach to flower selection, the
Allotment and Gardens Association, the Scouts who presented the results of their
village litter-pick, the Primary School who displayed their award-winning
project on "Up-cycling", and Totally Locally who stressed the environmental
importance of sourcing goods and services locally.

Organisations that attended from outside the village included Wharfedale
Naturalists, Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, The British Trust for Ornithology, the
RSPB, the Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust (YDRT), Energy Saving Trust, Ilkley Real
Food Market, Bradford Council, Rodley Nature Reserve and Hedgehog Emergency
Rescue Bingley.

Displays were not limited to science. In the refreshment room artists Geraldine
Thompson and Lisa Hinds exhibited their work focussing on painting influenced by
wildlife and the natural environment and Sue Ross exhibited the work of her art
group. A powerpoint slideshow by Don Barrett illustrating changes that have
taken place in the village over the last few decades attracted much attention.
There was also wildlife face painting by Natalie Munro and other activities for
children, and on sale there were greetings cards based on village wildlife
designed by Diane Morris, booklets of Addingham countryside walks designed by
Don Barrett, Jonathan White and Will Varley (updating two of the walks
originally published by Alison Armstrong in 1992) as well as second hand books.
Music wasn't forgotten as a recording of a concert of operatic arias organised
by Hilary Thomas and made in the Methodist Church the previous Saturday played
in the background. Hilary donated the proceeds of the concert to the Environment
Group.

Tea and coffee with home-made cakes were provided by Brenda Crooks and her team.

Professor Rick Battarbee, an expert in environmental matters, who leads the
group said: "The Addingham Environment Group Steering Committee would like to
thank all those who attended the Environment Day especially those who helped in
its organisation."

SINCE my last Nature Notes on May 18 I have received enthusiastic confirmation
that cuckoos have arrived on Ilkley Moor albeit slightly later than usual. This
is especially reassuring as we know cuckoo numbers are declining in England -
though holding up in Scotland, apparently. It's difficult to pinpoint reasons
for decline of long-distance migrants; there are so many dangers en route -
weather conditions, climate change causing serious alterations in already
challenging terrain, human interference through agriculture, building or direct
persecution like hunting or trapping - all across vast swathes of sparsely
populated land and, of course, sea. Few eager bird spotters!

Some encouraging news reached me last week from the British Trust for
Ornithology. In 2011 a research project was set up whereby tiny radio
transmitters were fitted to young male cuckoos. This enabled them to be tracked
on their journeys to the Congo rain forest where they spend our winter and back
here again. It's salutary to be reminded that "our" cuckoos actually spend only
15% of the year here. They spend 38% in their African home and the rest of the
time in travelling. Interestingly, while it takes them two months to get here in
Spring, they spend four months on the return trip. All that rush to breed is
over and they can take their time! It still amazes me that each youngster has to
find its own way - no reassuring flock to follow or parent to teach how to do
it. Parents are long gone - some leaving as early as the end of June - well
before the nestling is ready to fly We may be finding out lots about the "where"
of cuckoo migration: the "how" remains more mysterious. And it's not an exact
science, the BTO newsletter reported that of the five named cuckoos you could
follow on the internet, four had returned to their home range and one (David)
had been lost. Disaster may have struck poor David, or, perhaps, his transmitter
battery had given out. Let's hope it was the latter. Meanwhile, even smaller
transmitters have been developed, each weighing less than a 5p piece, and it's
planned to tag an additional 50 new birds this season.

New technology is being used to find answers to many vital questions, and it's
not a one-way street. Narwhals are being recruited to assist in research into
ice melt and ocean temperatures around Greenland. Fitted with thermometers, they
will transmit data via satellite as they feed around the calving ice caps:
information vital for our understanding of global warming and all our futures.

HEADLINE: Paris agreement: Theresa May tells Donald Trump she is 'disappointed'
at decision to withdraw from climate deal;
Leaders of France, Germany and Italy have released joint statement lamenting
withdrawal

BYLINE: Jon Sharman

BODY:

Theresa May has expressed regret over Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the
Paris climate accord in a personal phone call with the US President.

Ms May did not put her name to a joint statement released by the leaders of
France, Germany and Italy on Thursday evening but told Mr Trump of her belief
the Paris agreement represented "the right global framework for protecting the
prosperity and security of future generations".

A Downing Street spokesman said: "President Trump called the Prime Minister this
evening to discuss his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement.

Trump 'misunderstood climate research he cited in Paris accord speech'

"The Prime Minister expressed her disappointment with the decision and stressed
that the UK remained committed to the Paris Agreement, as she set out recently
at the G7.

"She said that the Paris Agreement provides the right global framework for
protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping
energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses.

"The President made clear that the door remains open to future US involvement in
the Agreement."

The spokesman added: "The Prime Minister and President agreed on the importance
of continued cooperation on wider energy issues."

A statement released by Angela Merkel's spokesperson on Twitter said she was
"disappointed w/ Pres Trump's decision. Now more than ever we will work for
global climate policies that save our planet".

Trump announces exit from the Paris climate agreement

She issued a joint statement alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni that said the agreement could not be
re-negotiated, pouring cold water onMr Trump's claim he would try to do so.

The trio said: "We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015
irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be
renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and
economies."

Business leaders including Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and General Electric
boss Jeff Immelt also criticised Mr Trump's decision.

Mr Musk said he would step down from the President's advisory committee.

HEADLINE: Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated despite Trump's claims, says
France, Germany and Italy in joint statement;
The US president thinks the deal is 'unfair' to American workers

BYLINE: Mythili Sampathkumar

BODY:

Italy, France and Germany have said they regretted US President Donald Trump's
decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and dismissed his suggestion
that the global pact could be revised.

At his White House withdrawal announcement, Mr Trump complained that the global
agreement signed by nearly 200 countries during the previous Obama
administration was "unfair" to American workers, imposed "draconian"
restrictions on US sovereignty and domestic economic activities, and has
withdrawn the US from it "as of today."

"We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we
firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a
vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies," the leaders of the
three countries said in a rare joint statement.

Mr Trump commented that "if we can get a deal, that's great. If not, that's
fine."

"We are convinced that the implementation of the Paris Agreement offers
substantial economic opportunities for prosperity and growth in our countries
and on a global scale," the three leaders said.

"We therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris
Agreement, including its climate finance goals and we encourage all our partners
to speed up their action to combat climate change."

The joint statement is slightly unusual, but the EU forms a strong bloc under
the Paris Agreement, with members often establishing continent-wide goals as
well as national ones.

Sue Biniaz, former US State Department Deputy Legal Adviser on climate, told

The Independent

that she thinks the joint statement "

is driven by the Paris Agreement's careful balancing and accommodation of
interests, very much already including those of the US."

"There's no legal reason why it couldn't be amended, but I don't think it needs
to be amended or "renegotiated" in order to address the concerns raised by the
President," said Ms Biniaz.

"The US has the ability to change its own targets," Todd Stern, the Special
Envoy on Climate Change during the Obama administration, told

The

Independent.

The carbon emissions targets and financial contributions to the various funds
set up through the UN, the Green Climate Fund, and bilateral commitments can be
changed based on each countries' prerogatives.

Mr Stern said it was "extremely hard to imagine any country wanting to
renegotiate [the agreement] because they felt the US got a bum deal."

The other issue is figuring out "what the President even means by that," said Mr
Stern.

Mr Trump did not go into specifically what points in the Paris accord he wants
to amend that would require bringing countries back to the negotiating table
after the more than 20 years of talks it took to get to the final text.

He has said that the deal would hit the US coal industry hard and that it would
prove "too costly" for US to stick to the Paris accord to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. But Mr Trump ignores the fact that new money in renewable energy
outpaced new investments in fossil fuels for the first time in 2015 to the tune
of $350bn.

However, the numbers Mr Trump presented - notably losing 2.7 million jobs by
2025 - are inaccurate and do not take into account normal job rate loss and
creation, jobs shifting towards more 'green' sectors, and the tangible benefits
of cleaner air, water, and less risk of natural disasters along US coastlines.

Mr Trump also attacked developing countries, including in China and India who
are top polluters but also leaders in solar energy, for relying on foreign aid
in order to grow.

His comment that he wants "burdens...equally shared by countries all around the
world" in a renegotiated deal shows a lack of understanding of the agreement,
which was formulated in a way to account for the historical climate damage done
by wealthy countries to poorer countries and provisions to help developing
countries to grow their economies without over-reliance on the same fossil fuel
method.

France, Italy, and Germany said they "will step up efforts to support developing
countries, in particular the poorest and most vulnerable, in achieving their
mitigation and adaptation goals."

HEADLINE: Trump misunderstood our climate research he cited in Paris Agreement
speech, MIT scientists say;
'We certainly do not support the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement,'
says lead researcher

BYLINE: Emily Flitter

BODY:

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) officials have said USPresident
Donald Trump badly misunderstood their research when he cited it to justify
withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Mr Trump announced during a speech at the White House Rose Garden on Thursday
that he had decided to pull out of the landmark climate deal, in part because it
would not reduce global temperatures fast enough to have a significant impact.

"Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance
from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one
degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100," Trump said.

"Tiny, tiny amount."

Merkel says she will help 'save our planet' after Trump Paris exit

That claim was attributed to research conducted by MIT, according to White House
documents seen by Reuters.

The Cambridge, Massaschusetts-based research university published a study in
April 2016 titled "How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?"
showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming
would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.

"We certainly do not support the withdrawal of the USfrom the Paris agreement,"
said Erwan Monier, a lead researcher at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and
Policy of Global Change, and one of the study's authors.

"If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more and that would
be catastrophic," said John Reilly, the co-director of the program, adding that
MIT's scientists had had no contact with the White House and were not offered a
chance to explain their work.

The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit
global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through country pledges to
cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

Under the pact, the United States - the world's second biggest carbon emitter
behind China -had committed to reduce its emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per
cent from 2005 levels by 2025.

A senior administration official defended Mr Trump's use of the findings. "It's
not just MIT. I think there is a consensus, not only in the environmental
community, but elsewhere that the Paris agreement in and of itself will have a
negligible impact on climate," the official told reporters at a briefing.

Trump announces exit from the Paris climate agreement

The dispute is the latest round of a years-long battle between scientists and
politicians over how to interpret facts about the effects of burning fossil
fuels on the global climate, and translate them into policy.

Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change and once called
it a hoax perpetrated by China to weaken USbusiness.

change: Read it in full;
Mr Trump fulfilled a campaign promise in announcing that the US is withdrawing
from the accord

BYLINE: Clark Mindock

BODY:

President Donald Trump has announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris
climate accord, saying that he's doing so in order to protect American jobs and
the economy in the US.

The president made the announcement from the White House Rose Garden on a warm
day in Washington. He was joined by his Vice President, and several members of
his cabinet.

He announced his decision in a lengthy speech that touched on a range of issues.
Read the full prepared remarks below.

Trump confirms withdrawal from Paris Agreement on climate change

Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing
the terrorist attack in Manila. We're closely monitoring the situation, and I
will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
But it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with
terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.

Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our
tremendous - absolutely tremendous - economic progress since Election Day on
November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.
We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a
million private sector jobs.

I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion
of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of
thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause.)
Thank you. Thank you.

[4:43]

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy
restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as
2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research
Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs - not what we need -
believe me, this is not what we need - including automobile jobs, and the
further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities
rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.

According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into
place by the previous administration would cut production for the following
sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38
percent; coal - and I happen to love the coal miners - down 86 percent; natural
gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3
trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would
have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.

Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it
fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about
the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that
punishes the United States - which is what it does -- the world's leader in
environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the
world's leading polluters.

For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions
by a staggering number of years - 13. They can do whatever they want for 13
years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions
and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is
very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.

Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean
coal in America - which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We're
having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many
places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many
years, that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try.

China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't
build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be
allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double
their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed
to continue construction of coal plants.

In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those
jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining
a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded
when we signed the Paris Agreement - they went wild; they were so happy - for
the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which
we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the
obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the
agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic
wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other
parts of the world.

We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to
lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this
agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking
away the great wealth of our nation - it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth;
not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth - and leaving millions and
millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other
countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our
domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms
of available American energy, or our country - (applause) - will be at grave
risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many
cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost
jobs and a very diminished quality of life.

Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from
all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -
think of that; this much - Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year
2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone
would wipe out the gains from America - and this is an incredible statistic -
would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year
2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs,
closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and
for our homes.

As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: "The reality is that withdrawing
is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate." The
United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest
and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We'll be the cleanest. We're
going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will
be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of
work and we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow; we're going to
grow rapidly. (Applause.)

And I think you just read - it just came out minutes ago, the small business
report - small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the
best reports they've seen in many years.

I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our
way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its
workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.
(Applause.)

So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them
non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.
And we'll make it good, and we won't be closing up our factories, and we won't
be losing our jobs. And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people
that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much
better than the Paris Accord. And I think the people of our country will be
thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until
we do that, we're out of the agreement.

I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental
issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and
responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.

No responsible leader can put the workers - and the people - of their country at
this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal
hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world's top polluting
countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists
wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:
It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not
going to happen while I'm President. I'm sorry. (Applause.)

My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level
playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that
make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the
highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.

Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well. I
think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are
working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we
may have to go it alone. But it's going very well.

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise
from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to
gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I
always will. (Applause.)

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have
collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practises
and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see
what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.

At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at
us as a country?  We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair
treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries
laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be.

I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Applause.) I
promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's
interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we
have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under
renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we're down to
business.

Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes
yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the
so-called Green Climate Fund - nice name - which calls for developed countries
to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing
and massive foreign aid payments. So we're going to be paying billions and
billions and billions of dollars, and we're already way ahead of anybody else.
Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never
pay one dime.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially
tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over
$1 billion - nobody else is even close; most of them haven't even paid anything
- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism.
That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me. They came just
before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money.

In 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly
described the $100 billion per year as "peanuts," and stated that "the $100
billion Anchoris the tail that wags the dog." In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's
executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would
increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the
money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?

Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the
Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped
cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions
of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of
dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very
countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of
that.

There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in
Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to
the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus,
our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's
sovereignty. (Applause.) Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the
world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honour to protect it. And I
will.

Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States
as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant
energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been
unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from
conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we
face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better
deal.

The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and
more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting
point - as bad as it is - not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects
the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty and
massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if
we stay in.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American
people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers,
weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a
permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit
the Paris Accord - (applause) - and time to pursue a new deal that protects the
environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.

It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania - along with many, many other locations within our great country -
before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. (Applause.) Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and
reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other
nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps
even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism
are greatly stepped up - and you see that, you see it all over - from the
previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major
contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made
by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contribution.

One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my
campaign for President -- whether it's cutting job-killing regulations;
appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place
tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on
our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the
United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
And believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very
shortly even more so.

On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments.
And I don't want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the
great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to
protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris
Climate Accord - (applause) - thank you, thank you - but begin negotiations to
reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms
that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its
taxpayers. So we're getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see
if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't,
that's fine. (Applause.)

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American
citizens. The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington
entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive
benefit of other countries, leaving American workers - who I love - and
taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered
factories, and vastly diminished economic production.

Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the
non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the
agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the
nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund
which is costing the United States a vast fortune.

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh mayor attacks Trump for saying he withdrew from Paris
agreement for people of Pittsburgh;
Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton. It also supports regulating greenhouse
gases

BYLINE: Clark Mindock

BODY:

The mayor of Pittsburgh has torn into Donald Trump after the president said he
was "elected to represent Pittsburgh not Paris."

Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor, noted on Twitter that his city voted
overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and said that his city
would still adhere to the guidelines put in place by the Paris accord that Mr
Trump is pulling the US out of.

"As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines
of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy, and future," Mr Peduto wrote
in one of the messages.

Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated despite Trump's claims

"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80 percent of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
stands with the world, and will follow Paris Agreement," he wrote in another.

That message was later seen by the mayor of Paris, who wrote that Paris and
Pittsburgh "stand together" in the Paris agreement.

Pittsburgh voters, in addition to preferring a world in which Ms Clinton is
sitting behind the Resolute Desk, also tend to support regulating carbon
dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, as a pollutant. A full 80 percent of adults in
Pittsburgh support doing so Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh,
according to Yale University's Climate Change Communication. When accounting for
the whole Pittsburgh metropolitan area the support drops only slightly, to 77
percent.

Mr Trump promised on the campaign trail to pull the United States out of the
Paris climate agreement, which was negotiated for heavily by former President
Barack Obama. During the campaign, Mr Trump said that climate change was a hoax
perpetuated by the Chinese, and later mocked the idea that climate change -
which is a calculation based temperature measurements over an extended period of
time - exists because the Northeast United States went through a cold spell
while he was in his New York penthouse.

HEADLINE: Paris agreement: Angela Merkel says she will help 'save our planet'
after Trump's withdrawal from climate deal;
Chancellor teams up with Emmanuel Macron and Paolo Gentiloni to present united
front

BYLINE: Jon Sharman

BODY:

                     Angela Merkel has responded to Donald Trump's decision to
pull out of the Paris climate agreement and that she will continue efforts to
tackle global warming.

Astatement released by Ms Merkel's spokesperson on Twitter said she was
"disappointed w/ PresTrump's decision. Now more than ever we will work for
global climate policies that save our planet".

Mr Trump announced on Thursday the US would withdraw from the accords, which he
cast as a ploy by other global powers to gain "financial advantage" over
America.

He said he would try to re-negotiate a better deal for the US because the
agreements would have threatened US "sovereignty".

Elon Musk quits as Trump adviser over Paris Agreement withdrawal

But Ms Merkel issued a joint statement alongside French President Emmanuel
Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni that said the agreement could
not be re-negotiated.

The trio said: "We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015
irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be
renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and
economies."

Trump announces exit from the Paris climate agreement

The United Nations called Mr Trump's decision "a major disappointment".

Mr Trump, who had made pulling out of the pact - which has been signed by most
of the world's - a central plank of his run for the presidency, said that in
withdrawing he was "keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first".

He said he wants to talk to citizens of "Pittsburgh, not Paris" to cheers in the
crowd of the Rose Garden at the White House.

The President had been put under extreme pressure by allies around the world to
stay in the agreement, and though administration said his views on the subject
were "evolving" - having previously claimed climate change was a "hoax" - Mr
Trump refused to be backed into a corner.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump suggests global conspiracy behind Paris Agreement with
activists stealing US wealth;
'You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those who keep an open mind.'

BYLINE: Clark Mindock

BODY:

                     Donald Trump has appeared to suggest that a network of
conspirators were pushing the Paris climate agreement in order to steal American
wealth.

Mr Trump announced that the United States would be pulling out of that landmark
agreement during a speech from the White House Rose Garden, heavily emphasising
his belief that the deal hurts American jobs to the benefit of foreign nations.

The Paris climate agreement "handicaps the US economy in order to win praise
from the very global activists... that have long sought to gain wealth at our
expense," Mr Trump said in the Rose Garden, before appearing to suggest
something a bit more sinister was at work behind the scenes. "You see what's
happening. It's pretty obvious to those who keep an open mind."

Trump confirms withdrawal from Paris Agreement on climate change

Withdrawing from the climate agreement drew immediate ire from Democrats in
Washington - former President Barack Obama -the international community, and
climate activists working to curb or stop the impacts of climate change on the
world.

The decision puts the United States in a small group of nations that are not a
part of the Paris accord. While the US played a pivotal roll in leading
negotiations on the Paris climate change agreement under the direction of former
President Barack Obama, it now sits with just Nicaragua and Syria outside of the
global group participating in Paris.

While Mr Trump argued that he was acting in order to boost American energy jobs
and security, major energy companies urged him not to retreat from the Paris
accord in the weeks leading up to his announcement. That included the CEO of
Shell, as well Exxon shareholders, the former employer of Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.

Mr Trump had previously said that he thinks that climate change is a hoax, and
had openly mocked the concept on the 2016 campaign trail.

HEADLINE: Elon Musk quits as Trump adviser over Paris Agreement withdrawal: '
Climate change is real';
President says he seeks 'level playing field' for US and claims accords were

BODY:

                     Elon Musk has said he is leaving Donald Trump's advisory
council over the President's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords.

The Tesla and SpaceX founder tweeted: "Am departing presidential councils.
Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world."

He had threatened to depart the economic advisory role if his advice on climate

Barack Obama attacks Donald Trump after he pulls US from climate deal

Mr Trump cast the Paris agreements as a global conspiracy that damaged the
United States' economic prospects, but said the country may attempt to re-join
the pact if he can secure a better deal.

The agreement was more about other nations gaining "financial advantage" over
the US than about the environment, he claimed.

The President sought a "level playing field" and to establish "highest standard
of living, highest standard of environmental protection", he said during a
speech in the White House Rose Garden.

Mr Musk hadbeen a key tech industry advisor for the White House. He praised Mr
Trump's appointment of former Exxon Mobil head Rex Tillerson as Secretary of
State because Mr Tillerson said he believed climate change is real and he also
supported a carbon tax on companies to discourage high emissions.

The electric car entrepreneurwas not the only business leader to criticise Mr

Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of the conglomerate General Electric, tweeted:
"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is
real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

HEADLINE: Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate-change accord is more
symbol than substance;
America will make progress on climate change despite its President, through
market forces and action at state level

BYLINE: Editorial

BODY:

We had been warned. Donald Trump himself had promised during his election
campaign to take America out of the Paris climate agreement in his first 100
days as President. Not that all his campaign promises have run smoothly, and he
showed some signs of hesitating over this one. So he ran a little behind
schedule, but tonight, on day 132, he finally did it.

The delay gave those who want to see urgent global action to minimise climate
change plenty of time to prepare. By the time he uttered the words, "the United
States will withdraw", we should have come to a pretty good understanding of why
it matters and why it does not.

Read Obama's statement on Trump's withdrawal from Paris Agreement in f

It matters mostly because of the symbolism. The figurehead for the second
biggest producer of greenhouse gases has backed off from the first global
agreement to mitigate climate change, barely a year after Barack Obama finally
signed up to it. That shifts the balance of rhetorical forces behind the myriad
international agreements needed to put the high ideals of the Paris accord into
effect. Above all it breaks the cycle of positive actions that reinforce each
other as nations act separately and together towards an agreed goal.

On the other hand, it matters much less than suggested by President Trump's
dramatic language of fighting back against the "vastly diminished economic
production" forced on the US by the agreement.

What was significant was that the President repudiated the Paris deal, a process
that will take three years - until roughly the end of his first term, in other
words. He did not pull the US out of the UNFCCC, the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, which would have been a more serious step and
which requires only a year's notice. So the US will be part of the Paris deal
for the foreseeable future, while the President tries to negotiate new terms.

For a long time, it has been understood that the US presidency and Congress were
unlikely to help to drive forward international action on climate change. In the
end, the US signature on the Paris agreement was obtained only from Barack Obama
in his final year as a two-term president: it never went through Congress. And
so, although the flip in the White House's position isimportant, the real
progress is being made elsewhere and will continue to be made.

Trump confirms withdrawal from Paris Agreement on climate change

In America, that progress was always going to happen at state level and through
wider economic forces. The states have been driving towards renewable energy,
especially wind and solar, independently of federal government for decades now.
While market forces have been driving the growth of shale gas, which is cleaner
than the shrinking coal industry.

In Trump's mythical universe, the coal industry is a victim of other countries,
which "laugh at us" and tie America down for their commercial advantage. In
reality, it is the victim of a cleaner fossil-fuel rival. Of course, President
Trump's petulant, put-upon narrative of persecuted America strikes a chord in
the real world, in the former manufacturing powerhouse of Michigan and
Pennsylvania, the places where he won the presidency.

But Barack Obama is right. "The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will
be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created," he
commented, while the President was still speaking. The job opportunities of the
future lie in new, low-carbon industries. The coal industry is shrinking in
America as it will soon shrink elsewhere because clean industries are the growth
sectors of the future, not because of a conspiracy against it.

The tension between myth and reality showed through between the lines of
President Trump's speech. He said the Paris terms would cut global temperatures
by only two tenths of a degree Celsius by 2100 - "a tiny bit". Thus he
acknowledged the reality of global warming, moving the argument back to the
real-world argument about what to do about it and at what price.

That is a debate with which the rest of the world should continue to engage.

HEADLINE: Paris agreement latest: Barack Obama attacks Donald Trump for
'rejecting future' after pulling out of climate deal;
President says America will stop adhering to the emissions reductions standards

BYLINE: Tom Batchelor

BODY:

Barack Obama has accused Donald Trump of "rejecting the future" after he
confirmed he would pull America out of the landmark Paris climate deal.

The former US President said those nations that remained signed up to the accord
would "reap the benefits in jobs and industries created".

But he added: "This [Trump] Administration joins a small handful of nations that

Trump confirms withdrawal from Paris Agreement on climate change

Mr Obama's administration played a key role in negotiating the deal and the
two-term President made protecting the environment a priority for his
administration.

Speaking after Mr Trump announced America was withdrawing from the agreement
with immediate effect, the former President said the US "should be at the front
of the pack" when it came to lowering emissions and developing green technology.

"For the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement
opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash
high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale," Mr
Obama said.

Under the Paris Accord, the US agreed to reduce emissions by between 26 per cent
and 28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2025.

However, Mr Trump said America would stop adhering to the emissions reductions
standards immediately.

The Paris Agreement is a global deal agreed under the United Nations in the
French capital in December 2015, which will see action by all countries to curb
rising temperatures.

Then-president Mr Obama signed up to the deal, without ratification by the US
Senate, last year.

In pulling out, Mr Trump, who has described climate change as a hoax by the
Chinese to hurt US manufacturing, is honouring a pledge made on the campaign
trail to quit Paris and boost fossil fuel production at home.

He claims the deal allows countries such as China and India to continue
polluting, and gain a "financial advantage" over the US.

Here is the full statement from Mr Obama on the Paris climate agreement

A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever
global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world
we leave to our children.

It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that
achievement possible. It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of
other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership
and ambition possible was America's private innovation and public investment in
growing industries like wind and solar - industries that created some of the
fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the
longest streak of job creation in our history.

Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the
nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the
floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech,
low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.

The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the
benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America
should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American
leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that
reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will
step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future
generations the one planet we've got.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump confirms withdrawal from Paris Agreement on climate
change in huge blow for global deal;
The US president wants to 'renegotiate' a more 'fair' deal for the US

BYLINE: Mythili Sampathkumar, Alexandra Wilts

BODY:

                     Donald Trump has announced the withdrawal of the US from
the Paris agreement on climate change, saying he wants to "renegotiate" a fairer
deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

Mr Trump, who has made pulling out of the pact- which has been signed by almost
200 nations - a central plank of his run for the presidency, said that in
withdrawing he was keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first.

He said that "if we can get a deal, that's great. If not, that's fine."

The President had been put under extreme pressure by allies around the world to
stay in the agreement, and although the administration said his views on the
subject were "evolving" - having previously claimed climate change was a "hoax"
- Mr Trump refused to be backed into a corner.

May says Trump can pull out of the climate change deal if he wishes

He said he wants to talk to citizens of "Pittsburgh, not Paris" to cheers in the
crowd of the Rose Garden at the White House.

However, in a blow to Mr Trump, the nations of France, Germany and Italy put out
a statement saying that the Paris deal was "not renegotiable". That statement
followed a swift outcry from politicians including the former US President
Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that
she regretted Mr Trump's decision but she would continue to work hard to "save
the Earth".

Mr Trump has said that the deal would hit the US coal industry hard and that it
would prove "too costly" for the country to stick to the Paris accord to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. But Mr Trump ignores the fact that new money in
renewable energy outpaced new investments in fossil fuels for the first time in
2015 to the tune of $350bn.

During the campaign, Mr Trump said the accord would cost the US economy
trillions of dollars with no tangible benefit. Vice President Mike Pence said
that Mr Trump was putting "American energy first".

However, the numbers Mr Trump presented - notably losing 2.7 million jobs by
2025 - are inaccurate and do not take into account normal job rate loss and
creation, jobs shifting towards more "green" sectors, and the tangible benefits
of cleaner air, water, and less risk of natural disasters along US coastlines.

He also cited how "down" several industries had become recently: cement, iron,
steel, natural gas, and coal - "and I happen to love the coal miners", he said.
He failed to note that the renewable energy industry grew leaps and bounds and
provided nearly 64 per cent of all new electricity generating capacity
constructed in the US in 2015, according to the US Department of Energy.

At the start of his announcement on the climate deal, Mr Trump was at pains to
point out the "tremendous" progress the US economy has made since his election
in November - as well as the progress he had made on trade deals with partners
around the world.

He blamed the "tough trade practices" that other countries employed during the
Obama administration for the US losing trillions of dollars, but did not present
any evidence of it.

White House talking points stated that the Paris accord "was negotiated poorly
by the Obama Administration and signed out of desperation". Mr Trump called it
"another example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the US".

Pulling out of the agreement outright would take four years under the standard
cooling-off period for new international treaties - the route Mr Trump is likely
to take, but he said that the US is out "as of today".

While travelling abroad last week, Mr Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in
the deal by European leaders and the Pope.

American corporate leaders have also appealed to the
businessman-turned-president to stay in the pact. They include Apple, Google and
Walmart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the
United States should abide by the deal.

In a Berlin speech, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that fighting climate change
is a "global consensus" and an "international responsibility".

"China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment," said Mr Li.

Richard Gowan, a UN expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told

The Independent

that Mr Trump "may not care, but he has just created an astonishing opportunity
for the Chinese to assert themselves in the UN system".

Last year was the warmest since records began in the 19th century, as global
average temperatures continued a rise dating back decades that leading climate
scientists attribute to man-made greenhouse gas emissions that trap heat in the
atmosphere.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted on Thursday, "Climate
action is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do."

In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed Mr Trump to stay in the
pact last week at a meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) nations, described the
accord as essential and said she was pleased many other governments agreed.

A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) shows that the world's economies could boost economic growth by nearly
three per cent by 2021 if they institute policies that would lower greenhouse
gas emissions. By 2050 that growth could reach up to five per cent.

Mr Trump met on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has
favoured remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an
exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.

Mr Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, had discussed the possibility of
changing the US carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal
completely. His son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the
deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed.

Scientists say the Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming
sooner if the US retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to
rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions
of up to 3 billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year -
enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme
weather.

The Vatican, which under Pope Francis' insistence has strongly backed the
accord, sees a US exit as a disaster and "a huge slap in the face", Bishop
Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, a senior Vatican official, told the Rome newspaper

La Repubblica

.

During their meeting last month, the Pope gave Mr Trump a signed copy of his
2015 encyclical letter calling for the protection of the environment from
climate change. The letter also includedscientific evidence that climate
changeis caused by human activity.

Neither the pontiff's influence nor any discussions with world leaders seemed to
have had any bearing on Mr Trump. "They don't put America first. I do and always
will," is Mr Trump's resounding message to world.

Mr Trump repeatedly said the Paris deal would hurt US jobs, the economy, and the
"forgotten men and women" of America.

But, Mr Trump's own Secretary of State Rex Tillerson - a former Exxon Mobil CEO
- urged him to stay in the deal because reducing emissions and job growth can
occur simultaneously.

Secretary of Defence James Mattis has also told Mr Trump that withdrawing from
the Paris Agreement would make the job of the Pentagon more difficult. Mr Mattis
believes that adapting to a warming planet should be addressed by the whole
government to reduce the country's security risks.

Francesco Femia, Co-President of the Center for Climate and Security, a think
tank of senior retired military officers and national security experts, told

The Independent

that Mr Trump's decisionwill make "it difficult to cooperate with allies and
partners on a range of security issues".

Mr Trump said it was his "solemn duty to protect US citizens" and that is why he
is pullingthe US from the accord. But according to Mr Femia, the President's
decision creates "political penalties, but also strategic penalties" to
America's safety.

In "making America great again", Mr Trump took a swipe at India, China, and the
entire developing world. He said India makes its participation in the Paris deal
"contingent on billions and billions of foreign aid". This assertion isnot
wholly inaccurate, but the President failed to recognise thatIndiais a
developing nation with a poorinfrastructure to deal with a changing climate.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made the country's solar power production
and use a top priority for his administration, joining international alliances
and investing domestic and foreign funds into a variety of projects.

Mr Trump alsocomplained about China, lamenting that they are "allowed to open
hundreds of coal mines ... They can double [coal production] but we have to
reduce ours" by 2020. However, this is by design.

China signed a bliateral deal with the US under the Obama administration - ahead
of the Paris signing - and estimated they would need until 2030 to reach a
"peak" of carbon emissions - mostly through inexpensive coal burning - in order
to build up their economy to a point where they can afford to start
transitioning to more renewable sources of energy. After that time, China will
begin to reduce carbon emissions and increase the proportion of renewable
sources of energy. They are already a leader in solar panel production.

Mr Trump'scomment that he wants "burdens ... Equally shared by countries all
around the world" in a renegotiated deal shows a lack of understanding of the
agreement, which was formulated in a way to account for the historical climate
damage done by wealthy countries to poorer countries. The deal also
includesprovisions to help developing countriesgrow their economies without
over-relying on the same fossil fuel method.

White House officials said that the withdrawal agreement will be consistent with
what is required as part of the Paris agreement, which is that the pact needs to
be enforced for three years before a year-long process of formal withdrawal
begins. However officials said that "the President will not...do anything to
implement the current pledge".

HEADLINE: Bernie Sanders tears into Trump for pulling out of Paris Agreement:
'It is a disgrace';
'We do not have the moral right to turn our backs'

BYLINE: Clark Mindock

BODY:

Bernie Sanders says that Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States
from the Paris climate agreement is a disgrace.

Mr Sanders released his statement on the president's decision shortly before Mr
Trump stepped up to the Rose Garden podium to announce that the US would
withdraw from the accord, virtually pitting America against the vast majority of
the global community.

"President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate
agreement is an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace.
At this moment, when climate change is already causing devastating harm around
the world, we do not have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to
preserve this planet for future generations," Mr Sanders said.

Angela Merkel defends 'essential' Paris Agreement on climate change

Retreating from the pledges in the Paris climate accord was a prominent
component of Mr Trump's 2016 campaign. The president repeatedly promised
American voters - particularly in places like Kentucky where whole communities
have been ravaged by declining coal demand and competitiveness - that he would
bring back American energy jobs, even if they yield a heavy responsibility for
greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Trump also mocked the idea of climate change during
the 2016 campaign.

But Mr Sanders said that the issue of climate change was too dire to not
address, and Americans would have to address the growing threat one way or
another.

"The United States must play a leading role in the global campaign to stop
climate change and transition rapidly away from fossil fuels to renewable and
more efficient sources of energy," he said. "We must do this with or without the
support of Donald Trump and the fossil fuel industry."

It appears that states will now lead the charge when it comes to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in the US. The California legislature, for instance, is
currently considering measures that would require the state to become completely
reliant on renewable energy - like solar and wind power - by 2045.

HEADLINE: Angela Merkel defends 'essential' Paris Agreement on climate change;
Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the US from the accord

BYLINE: Alexandra Wilts

BODY:

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the Paris climate deal as an
"essential" pact and said she was pleased that many other governments took the
same view.

Ms Merkel's statement comes as several world leaders attempt to lobby Donald
Trump into keeping the US in the accord that aims to fight climate change.
According to reports, the President is set to announcethat he is pulling the
countryout of the agreement.

EU President Donald Tusk pleaded with Mr Trump on Twitter to not "change the
(political) climate for the worse" by withdrawing, while Russian President
Vladimir Putin expressed support for the accord, saying it would be less
effective without the participation of major countries.

Mr Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was continuing to hear arguments
from both sides of the issue.

On Saturday, Ms Merkel said at the conclusion of a G7 summit in Italy that a
debate between leaders over climate had been "very unsatisfying".

"There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris
Agreement or not," Ms Merkel said at the time.

Despite recent reports that the US is poised to withdraw from the deal, other
countries along with Russia- including India and China - have reaffirmed their
commitment to fighting global warming.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told Ms Merkel during a meeting that China will
"continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the
2030 goal step by step steadfastly."

"But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others," he added.

In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit the rise of the global
average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

Representatives from 196 nations also agreed to adopt green energy sources and
cut down on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

The US is currently one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.
Scientists say that Earth is likely to to be affected by more dangerous levels
of warming even sooner if the US pulls back from its pledge to cut carbon
dioxide pollution.

HEADLINE: Congressman says 'God will take care of climate change' if it is real;

The comment comes as Donald Trump is set to make an announcement on the Paris
Agreement on climate change

BYLINE: Mythili Sampathkumar

BODY:

Republican Congressman Tim Walberg has said that God will address climate
changeif it is real and that humans can do nothing to help the planet.

The Michigan House member was speaking in Coldwater, Michigan when he said he
believes "there's been climate change since the beginning of time. I believe
there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah, of course. Can man
change the entire universe? No."

He went on to say that as a Christian he has faith that "if there's a real
problem, [God] can take care of it."

The comments come just beforeDonald Trumpis set to make an announcement on
whether the US will stay in the historicParis Agreementon climate change, which
almost 200 countriessigned in an effort to lower carbon emissions and tackle the
effects of global warming.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump withdrawing from Paris agreement will be like slapping
the Pope in the face, Vatican says;
Not believing the deal is necessary is like thinking the world is flat, says
senior Catholic bishop

BYLINE: Andrew Griffin

BODY:

Donald Trump's expected withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement will
be like slapping the Pope in the face, according to the Vatican.

The Pope has strongly and repeatedly backed the landmark global warming deal.
But Donald Trump has said that he will get rid of it - despite receiving counsel
from the Pope, and claiming to be a Christian.

The Vatican said that Mr Trump's reasoning for doing so - that he thinks the US
must rely on unclean power sources like coal - is the same as believing that the
Earth is flat.

A withdrawal "would not only be a disaster but completely unscientific," said
Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences,
which has hosted numerous international conferences on climate change. "Saying
that we need to rely on coal and oil is like saying that the earth is not round.
It is an absurdity dictated by the need to make money."

Delaware-sized iceberg set to send Trump message about global warming

The president has said that global warming is a hoax, despite the evidence, and
that it is economically necessary for him to pull out of the deal.

Bishop Sanchez Sorando suggested that to do so would also be a personal insult
to the Pope himself.

"If he really does (pull out), it would be a huge slap in the face for us," he
said. "It will be a disaster for everyone," he told the Rome newspaper La
Repubblica.

Mr Trump is expected to announce that he is pulling out in a ceremony at the
Rose Garden. But it is widely reported that he will pull out of the deal, which
was brokered by Barack Obama and is said to be necessary to ensure the world
avoids some of the worst parts of climate change.

HEADLINE: 'Three minutes of nothing': Local reporter shares experience of
Theresa May interview;
'I couldn't pick anything out of her answers which would have made for an
interesting story,' Sam Blackledge tells The Independent

BYLINE: Lucy Pasha-Robinson

BODY:

A local reporter who interviewed Theresa May has told of the moment he realised
he had come away with "absolutely nothing."

Sam Blackledge had hoped to get a "good local line" from the Prime Minister on
Brexit and transport links for

The Plymouth Herald.

However, he said Ms May rebuffed all of his questions with "non-answers" and
"soundbites".

"I couldn't pick anything out of her answers which would have made for an
interesting story," he told

The Independent.

"It wasn't until afterwards, driving back to the office, that I realised I had
nothing. She hadn't addressed any of my questions directly, and I actually
thought it had been a disaster."

He added: "If the job of a journalist is to get answers, I had failed. But then
we realised we could make a story out of the non-answers."

The interview has since gone viral after the paper published an excerpt of Ms
May's "soundbite" responses, titled "Three minutes of nothing".

Mr Blackledge said he thought he had been in the "right place at the right time
to capture the mood", as political campaigning reaches a fever pitch just seven
days ahead of the general election.

He wrote: "Before 8.30am today, I had never interviewed a Prime Minister.
Heading back to the office to transcribe my encounter with Theresa May at
Plymouth's fish market, I couldn't be certain that had changed."

The reporter asked just four questions during the encounter on Sutton Harbour:

Plymouth Herald:

"Two visits in six weeks to one of the country's most marginal constituencies -
is she getting worried?"

Ms May:

"I'm very clear that this is a crucial election for this country."

Plymouth Herald:

"Plymouth is feeling the effects of military cuts. Will she guarantee to protect
the city from further pain?"

Ms May:

"I'm very clear that Plymouth has a proud record of connection with the armed
forces."

Plymouth Herald:

"Will you promise to sort out our transport links?"

Ms May:

"I'm very clear that connectivity is hugely important for Plymouth and the
south-west generally."

The interview garnered widespread criticism on social media, with commentators
accusing Ms May of having "contempt for the democratic process" and being
"robotic".

It came on the same day Ms May was accused of dodging a televised leaders
debate, attended by her opposition rival Jeremy Corbyn.

"I hope that next time we get a ministerial visit, they will provide proper
answers and not just soundbites," Mr Blackledge said.

It is not the first time Ms May has been accused of reeling off stock answers.

Her overuse of soundbites during the election campaign, including "strong and
stable" and "coalition of chaos", has attracted heavy criticism from some
Westminster commentators.

HEADLINE: European carbon footprint maps show places doing most and least to
cause climate change;
The South-west of England has one of the highest average carbon footprints,
while people in Romania have some of the lowest

BYLINE: Ian Johnston

BODY:

People in the South-west of England have one of the biggest 'carbon footprints'
in Europe, according to new research.

The study found that large urban centres - such as the London conurbation,
northern Italy, Paris and the surrounding area, and Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany
- produced vast amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.

However, a different picture emerged when the researchers looked at the average
emissions for each household in 177 regions of all the EU countries (apart from
newest memberCroatia).

Average household carbon footprint in tonnes of carbon dioxide (

Ivanova

et al, Environmental Research Letters)

The South-west produced the highest levels of emissions in the UK, followed by
the South-east, the Midlands and Scotland. Wales and the North-east had the
lowest levels.

Much of the rest of Europe performed significantly better than the UK:Romania,
Hungary and Bulgaria were among the best.

The average household in France, Spain, Sweden and Poland also had lower carbon

The researchers calculated the carbon costs of a range of products and services,
from food and clothing to transport, heating, manufactured goods and housing.

Diana Ivanova, lead author of a paper about the study (publishedin the journal

Environmental Research Letters

), told the Carbon Brief website: "We can essentially trace back all the
environmental impacts that are embodied in, say, the consumption of cheese by an
average Austrian - what kind of inputs were needed to produce the cheese and
where they come from, e.g. milk, labour, energy, transport."

She explained that by calculating emissions on a regional level, local councils
could monitor the effect of policies, such as flexible working hours and new
bike lines, that can reduce congestion at peak commuting times.

World must hit zero carbon emissions 'well before 2040'

"Of course, to enable this we would need a continuous monitoring of
consumption-based environmental impacts," said Ms Ivanova, a PhD candidate at
the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Transport is a particular problem.

"The majority of direct emissions are tailpipe emissions associated with private
use of vehicles," the paper reported.

"Transport contributes to about 30 per cent of EU household emissions, with
importance across regions varying between 13 to 44 per cent with the majority of
impacts coming from burning of transport fuel."

Food was also responsible for considerable amounts of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases.

"Food is a significant source of household emissions,contributing to about 17
per cent of EU household emissions and a varying importance of 11 to 32 per cent
across regions," the paper said.

HEADLINE: Ivanka Trump's shoes are made in China but not for long;
As President Donald TrumpaccusesChina of stealing jobs, those jobs are now
leaving for other shores

BYLINE: Keith Bradsher

BODY:

The Chinese factory workers who make shoes for Ivanka Trump and other designers
gather at 7.40am every morning to sing songs.

Sometimes, they extol worker solidarity. Usually, they trumpet ties between
China and Africa, the theme of their employer's corporate anthem.

That is no accident. With many workers here complaining about excessive hours
and seeking higher pay, the factory owner wants to send their jobs to Ethiopia.

Concerns grow for missing activists probing Ivanka Trump shoe factory

The employer, Huajian International, now faces scrutiny from labour activists
for how it treats workers. Chinese authorities this week detained an activist
who went undercover in the company's factory here for a labour rights group. Two
other activists who worked at Huajian are missing; it is unclear whether they
were detained.

The activists' focus on Huajian's factories points to changing labour conditions
in China as manufacturers try to get more work out of an increasingly expensive
labour pool.

Ms Trump's father campaigned for the USpresidency on a platform of bringing back
overseas manufacturing jobs. But deep economic and demographic shifts mean a lot
of low-end work -like making shoes -does not offer huge profit in China. As
President Donald Trump accuses China of stealing jobs, those jobs are now
leaving for other shores.

Huajian, which makes shoes for a number of American brands, was a major
beneficiary of the decadeslong shift of manufacturing jobs away from the United
States. Global brands flocked to China to tap into the country's cheap and
willing labour pool.

Today, Chinese workers are less cheap and less willing. More young people are
going to college and want office jobs. The blue-collar workforce is ageing. Long
workdays in a factory no longer appeal to those older workers, even with the
promise of overtime pay.

In interviews in December and again Sunday and Monday outside Huajian's vast
industrial complex in this southern Chinese factory city, numerous workers
interviewed by

The New York Times

complained about 14-hour days. While many liked the overtime pay, they said the
days were too long, especially since they often included up to three hours of
unpaid breaks for lunch and dinner. The workers insisted on anonymity for fear
of retaliation by management.

China Labour Watch, the advocacy group investigating the factories, said it
found that employees had worked longer weeks than Chinese labour law allows,
even excluding breaks. Such violations are common in Chinese factories.

A Huajian spokesman, Wei Xuegang, said the company knew nothing about the
activists. Asked about the accusation from China Labour Watch, he said Huajian
scheduled extra hours during busy times but paid workers according to the law.
In a December interview, Zhang Huarong, the company's founder and chairman, said
Huajian followed overtime laws.

The Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment on the labour conditions or the
activists. In terms of bringing jobs back to the US, the company said, it was
"looking forward to being a part of the conversation."

Such tensions are fuelling the drive of Huajian's founder, MrZhang, to move work
to Ethiopia. A former drill sergeant in the Chinese military who sometimes leads
his workers on parade-ground drills, MrZhang says work like making shoes will
never return to the United States and is increasingly difficult in China as
well.

"Do Americans really like to work, to do these simple and repetitive tasks?"
said MrZhang, in the December interview. "Young Chinese also don't want to do
this after they graduate from college."

In many respects, China's economy is maturing.

Read more

Have we reached peak China?

The number of people who turn 18 each year and do not enrol in college -the
group that might consider factory work -had plummeted to 10.5 million by 2015
from 18.5 million in 2000, government data shows.

Because of the effects from China's former "one child" policy, the figure is on
track to fall below 7 million by 2020.

Costs are rising too, as the government raises minimum wages and benefits in an
effort to shift China's economy away from cheap manufacturing. Wages in Dongguan
have increased ninefold since the late 1990s, MrZhang said.

Workers said they resented the hours, especially the unpaid breaks.

Behind China's $1 trillion plan to shake up the economic order

One employee's printed schedule in December showed that the factory required 60
hours and 10 minutes of paid work per week. Chinese laws require that workweeks
average no more than 44 hours and limit overtime to 36 hours per month.

On Monday, in the middle of China's three-day Dragon Boat Festival holiday,
throngs of workers filed into the factory.

Asked whether he would be eating zongzi, the traditional rice dumpling served
during the holiday, one worker replied that they do not get to celebrate.
Another said Huajian gave each worker two small dumplings and an egg for the
holiday.

One worker, a middle-aged woman with the surname Du, said her children had gone
home to central China. Du wished for time off to celebrate, so she could make
rice dumplings for them.

MrZhang said that his company kept working hours within legal limits, despite
workers who want more overtime pay.

"We cannot let them work extra hours just because they have low pay," Mr Zhang
said in a lengthy interview. "We have thought about it, but we want to do
business well."

China Labour Watch said onTuesday that it had lost contact with three undercover
activists at Huajian factories. The wife of one in the factory in Dongguan said
he had been detained by the police.

Li Qiang, who started China Labor Watch 17 years ago, said the group's activists
had never before been detained by the police.

"I'm very worried about their safety," he said. "The longer I've lost contact
with them, the more I worry."

Huajian peaked at 26,000 employees in China in 2006. Staffing is down to between
7,000 and 8,000 thanks to automation and the shift to Ethiopia, MrZhang said.

Huajian produces 100,000 to 200,000 pairs of Ivanka Trump shoes each year, a
small fraction of the 8 million pairs of shoes it produces annually. The
Dongguan factory makes the heels while a second factory completes the shoes.
Marc Fisher Footwear, which licenses the Ivanka Trump brand for shoes
manufactured by Huaijian, has said it was looking into the allegations.

MrZhang has had occasional brushes with Chinese labour laws, although no more
than many employers in this increasingly litigious society. In 2014, Li Jianguo,
a worker, sued Huajian, saying he worked 104 hours of overtime per month and was
not paid for it. Huajian acknowledged in that case that the worker had been
putting in 52 hours of overtime per month, according to the text of the court
verdict, and agreed to pay him for that.

Mr Zhang said that workers earn $525 to $580 per month, including overtime pay
but not including company-paid benefits like medical insurance and housing
subsidies. Workers said that pay ranged from $380 to $580 per month.

The money can go a long way in a factory city like Dongguan. Workers said that a
215-square-foot apartment in the neighbourhood costs $29 a month to rent. The
company provides a monthly housing subsidy of $11.60.

Citing labour costs and the country's foreign investment push, Huajian is
building a sprawling complex of factories, office buildings and a hotel on the
southern outskirts of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Zhang's shoe factories
there already have 5,000 employees.

When finished in four years, the Addis Ababa complex will be ringed by a replica
of the Great Wall of China.

Some interviewed Huajian workers said they were not concerned about jobs being
moved to Ethiopia, given the plentiful number of jobs in China's southern
manufacturing zone.

Still, many longtime workers face age discrimination if they leave, as other
factories prefer workers under 35. Shoemaking is not strenuous and poses few
physical dangers, making it more appealing to older workers.

"I really couldn't get used to these long working hours at the beginning," one
worker said, "but I don't really have a choice."

HEADLINE: The BBC is censoring political content by banning 'Liar Liar' - but
not because it is biased towards the Government;
Our national broadcaster suffers from weak executives who don't have the courage
to take on the Government

BYLINE: Sunny Hundal

BODY:

What do we call it when a state broadcaster bans a song critical of the
government? Censorship? No, not in Iran - right here in Britain. Right now, in
fact.

The BBC claims that reggae band Captain SKA's "Liar Liar", which was at the top
of the iTunes chart last week, breaks impartiality rules during the election.
The song is about Theresa May, you see.

The BBC's stance sounds straightforward but something isn't quite right. Its
radio stations will report that "Liar Liar" reached No 1 on iTunes, but refuse
to play it. This matters, as playing a song because it tops the charts is a
different rationale to playing it because a DJ likes it. The former decision is
driven by public choice, the latter is a matter of personal taste. The former
shouldn't really be up for debate.

I asked Ofcom what they thought. They couldn't offer a view since it hadn't been
aired yet. I went through their rules covering elections (section 6) and found
nothing to justify the ban. The same goes for BBC guidelines. The song doesn't
advocate for one party over another; it is merely critical of the Government. I
found nothing to suggest that any music with a political message cannot be
played during elections.

In other words, the BBC has banned a political song not because of rules but
because it doesn't want to anger the Government. That is outrageous in itself.
But the real problem isn't just one banned song - it's that the BBC's rules on
"impartiality" have been broken. And moreover, that BBC bosses don't want a
fight with the Tory Government. The ban on "Liar Liar" illustrates the problem
with the prevailing culture at the top of the BBC.

The job of a journalist should be to get to the truth, not worry about
impartiality. It should be to serve the audience, not care for how politicians
feel they are being treated.

The problem with BBC news journalism in this instance is twofold: first, that
producers feel they are being balanced by giving each side equal time. That is a
convenient illusion. A news programme can be biased even if it offers two sides
equal time, merely by prioritising one story over another.

On Tuesday morning Corbyn briefly forgot his costings for a key policy in an
interview. There's no doubt it was a gaffe. But the BBC ran it as their top
story even at 10pm, on a day when Osborne slammed the PM over her key manifesto
pledges. In any other universe a former Chancellor criticising a former close
colleague would be big news. Instead the BBC led with a minor gaffe from the
morning.

This isn't a one-off either. For years BBC management didn't even acknowledge
the absurdity of having a "balanced" debate on climate change because,
apparently, the weight of scientific opinion counted for nothing. Now, after
acknowledging mistakes, BBC producers avoid accusations of bias by ignoring the
issue entirely. Its coverage of climate change on political programmes is almost
non-existent. It's barely featured anywhere this election.

General Election polls and projections: June 1

This isn't to say all attempts at balance are useless. I know plenty of
journalists and producers who try their best to offer all sides of the story.
But sometimes "false balance" does no one any favours.

The second problem is that BBC executives lack the courage to cross the
Government. Again, this isn't new, but it's now a glaring problem.

May has been so shameless in exploiting the media that some journalists have
become rightly exasperated. "Why does [Theresa May] go around just saying things
that aren't true?," Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy asked David Davis last
night. He had no answer. Other than the one interview by Andrew Neil, there has
been no such grilling across the BBC.

Our national broadcaster suffers from weak executives who don't have the courage
to take on the Government. It has plenty of excellent journalists but the
corporate culture fails them. And in turn that fails the vast majority of its
audience.

In the past a BBC executive may have defended playing Captain Ska's song by
saying they were simply reflecting popular public opinion.

HEADLINE: Theresa May says Donald Trump is free to pull out of the Paris
Agreement on climate change if he wishes;
'It's up to the President of the United States to decide what position the
United States is going to take on this matter'

BYLINE: Rob Merrick

BODY:

Theresa May says Donald Trump is free to pull out of the Paris Agreement if he
wishes, refusing to criticise his undermining of efforts to fight catastrophic
climate change.

The Prime Minister declined to echo other EU leaders who have urged the leader
of the world's largest economy - and second greatest polluter - to think again.

"It's up to the President of the United States to decide what position the
United States is going to take on this matter," she told reporters on the
campaign trail.

What is the Paris agreement and what would happen if Trump withdrew?

Ms May did point out that she, and other G7 leaders, had "made clear" their
determination to push ahead with the Paris Agreement at last week's summit.

But she refused to agree that Mr Trump's looming decision - expected tonight -
would be a "blow", or dent the so-called special relationship.

It is feared that other countries will follow the US in pulling out of the Paris
deal, fatally weakening international efforts to keep global temperatures below
the level that would trigger deadly climate change.

It is estimated that US withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere every year, by itself raising the global temperature
by 0.1-0.3C by the end of the century.

The 2015 Paris Accord aims to keep global temperatures "well below" the level of
2C above pre-industrial times and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C.

The White House has signalled that Mr Trump is likely to pull out of the
agreement, although the confirmation is not expected to come until 7pm, British
time.

The likely decision has been criticised by everyone from German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to the Kremlin and China's Premier Li Keqiang.

Even Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, said Britain wanted "to see America
continue to show leadership on climate change" - while Home Secretary Amber Rudd
called it "disappointing".

The comments came as the Prime Minister attempted to brush off a fresh opinion
poll, suggesting Britain is heading for a hung Parliament, insisting only "one
poll matters" - on election day itself

Ms May refused to criticise the President as she dodged a series of other
questions, including:

* What are the "dire consequences" she is warning about, if the Brexit
negotiations fail.

* Whether the £8bn pledged for the NHS would be extra money - saying simply
"look at our record".

* Whatlevel of economic damage she would be willing to accept as the price of
lower immigration - sticking to her pledge to cut it to "tens of thousands".

* Whether she watched the TV debate she declined to take part in - replying:
"Amber Rudd did an absolutely excellent job".

During her speech, the Prime Minister sought to paint a bright future for
Britain if she is trusted to compete Brexit, claiming: "The promise of Brexit is
great, the opportunities before us enormous.

"Because if we get Brexit right, then together we can do great things. We can
build a Britain beyond Brexit that is stronger, fairer and more prosperous than
it is today."

But Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat Europe spokesman, branded the speech
"delusional", saying: "Only a year ago, Theresa May declared that being in the
EU makes us more secure, more prosperous, more influential.

"The relentlessly upbeat assessment of Brexit in her speech today is a U-turn of
epic proportions.It is also dangerous, because it is calculated to distract
attention from the shark-infested waters which we are now entering."

HEADLINE: India convert domestic ports to green energy as US prepares to
withdraw from Paris Agreement;
The 'cash rich' will pump some of their profits into renewable energy, a senior
official says

BYLINE: Lucy Pasha-Robinson

BODY:

India is set to become the first country in the world to use green energy to
power its domestic ports.

The country's government has pledged to convert all 12 of its major domestic
ports to renewable energy by 2019.

The plans will see the ports powered with almost 200 megawatts (mw) of solar and
wind energy - a capacity officials hope could reach 500mw in the coming years.

"These renewable energy projects will help in the reduction of carbon emission

The Economic Times

.

"All our ports are cash-rich... The ports have started the process of setting up
renewable energy projects from profits."

Separately, Indian Railways has sharpened its focus on undertaking renewable
power projects andplans to install 1,000 mw of solar plants, which will be
installed on signalling panels and rooftops of rail stations

It comes as world leaders cemented their commitment to tackling climate change
as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.

Meanwhile, China is set to announce a deeper alliance with Europe to uphold the
international agreement signed by 195 countries in 2015.

The UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the US had already taken important
steps to cut emissions and progress needed to be made in China and India.

"The states of the US, where so many of the important decisions on emissions are
taken, have already made a huge amount of progress and that progress will
continue," he said.

"Further progress needs to be made by other countries - notably India, China and
others. They are huge emitters. We need to tackle this globally."

With falling prices of clean technology, some analysts say the switch to a low
carbon world is already unstoppable, and countries that fail to take advantage
of the shift will lose out.

HEADLINE: Paris climate agreement summary: What is it, how would Trump withdraw
and how will the world react?;
What would be the global consequences if US abandonedlandmark environmental
treaty?

BYLINE: Brad Plumer

BODY:

President Donald Trump is said to be considering withdrawing the United States
from the Paris climate agreement, a landmark accord reached in 2015 between 195
countries that seeks to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change by
curbing global greenhouse gas emissions.

The White House says it has not yet reached a final decision on Paris, and
hundreds of corporations and world leaders are lobbying the United States to
stay in the pact. Within the administration, some senior officials, including
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have warned the president that the diplomatic
repercussions from leaving could be severe.

A US withdrawal would not scuttle the Paris accord, but it could seriously
weaken global efforts to avoid drastic climate change. Here's a primer on how
the Paris agreement works - and what could happen if the United States leaves.

Q: What does the Paris climate deal actually do?

A: Under the Paris agreement, every country submitted an individual plan to
tackle its greenhouse gas emissions and then agreed to meet regularly to review
their progress and prod one another to ratchet up their efforts as the years
went by.

Unlike its predecessor treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris deal was intended
to be nonbinding, so that countries could tailor their climate plans to their
domestic situations and alter them as circumstances changed. There are no
penalties for falling short of declared targets. The hope was that, through peer
pressure and diplomacy, these policies would be strengthened over time.

Donald Trump to 'withdraw US from Paris Agreement on climate change'

Under the deal, the Obama administration pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas
emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as well as to commit up to
$3 billion in aid for poorer countries by 2020. (The United States has delivered
$1 billion to date.) China vowed that its emissions would peak around 2030 and
that it would get about 20 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources
by then. India would continue to reduce its carbon intensity, or CO2 output per
unit of economic activity, in line with historical levels.

While the current pledges would not prevent global temperatures from rising more
than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the threshold deemed
unacceptably risky, there is some evidence that the Paris deal's "soft
diplomacy" is nudging countries toward greater action. A recent study from the
Grantham Research Institute found that the mere existence of the accord had
prodded dozens of countries to enact new clean-energy laws.

Q: How would the United States withdraw from Paris?

A: Because the deal is nonbinding, there are no penalties if the United States
pulls out.

The Trump administration can invoke the accord's formal withdrawal mechanism,
which takes four years - though US officials could stop participating in any
future climate talks immediately. A future administration could, if it chose,
rejoin.

More radically, the Trump administration could withdraw from the underlying
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signalling a withdrawal
from all UN-sponsored climate discussions. It is not yet clear which option the
Trump administration would choose, if it decides to leave.

If the United States does leave, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as the only
two countries not participating in the accord.

The United States could also face serious diplomatic repercussions for leaving.
Europe, China and other countries may threaten to withhold cooperation on issues
the Trump administration cares about. In a more extreme case, other countries
could decide to impose carbon tariffs on the United States.

Q: What would withdrawal mean for US climate efforts?

A: Whether or not the United States leaves Paris, the Trump administration will
keep trying to dismantle the Obama administration's domestic climate policies,
including the Clean Power Plan to curtail emissions from power plants, and
various regulations on methane leaks from oil and gas operations. Those
rollbacks are still far from assured, however, and environmentalists plan to
challenge them in court.

Pulling out of Paris will not mean the end of all domestic efforts to reduce
emissions. States like California and New York plan to keep pursuing their own
programmes to clean up power plants and vehicles. And the private sector is
already shifting toward cleaner energy: Cheap natural gas and renewables will
continue to drive the retirement of coal plants.

But the United States will be doing far less about global warming than it
otherwise might have done. A recent analysis by the Rhodium Group estimated
that, under Trump's policies, USemissions will now most likely fall 15 to 19
percent below 2005 levels by 2025, rather than the 26 to 28 percent that the
Obama administration pledged.

Q: What will this mean for the fight against climate change?

A: Withdrawal by the United States could seriously undermine global efforts to
tackle global warming - but much will depend on how other countries react.

Leaders in Europe, China and India have insisted that they will carry on
tackling global warming without the United States. But the precise shape of
future climate talks remains an open question.

One possibility is that, with the world's second-largest emitter pulling out,
other countries may feel inclined to relax their own plans to curb greenhouse
gases. "Even in places like Europe, you have industry groups worried about
competitiveness," said David G. Victor, a professor of international relations
at the University of California, San Diego. A USwithdrawal, he notes, "makes the
politics in other countries that much harder."

Developing countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines may be more
reluctant to tackle their emissions if the United States pulls back on promised
aid to help them adjust to the worst effects of climate change.

Not everyone is so pessimistic, however. Luke Kemp, a climate policy expert at
Australian National University, suggests that other countries may choose to
redouble their pursuit of cleaner energy in the face of recalcitrance from the
Trump administration. "In the short term you could see a galvanising effect," he
said.

China, the world's largest emitter, is poised to assume a dominant role in
future talks. The country is investing heavily in wind, solar and nuclear power
in an attempt to level off its once-insatiable coal consumption. But it is
unclear how far China's leaders will go in pressuring other countries to raise
their ambitions. In the past, China has argued against rigorous transparency
standards to review nations' progress.

But the rest of the world will have a lot of heavy lifting ahead of it: Current
pledges, when added up, put the planet on pace to warm three degrees Celsius or
more above preindustrial levels, an outcome with a far greater risk of
destabilising ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, higher levels of sea-level
rise, more destructive heat waves and droughts, and the loss of vital ecosystems
like coral reefs.

One final variable: A future USadministration could always change course on
climate policy - and even try to rejoin the agreement once Trump is out of
office.

"Other countries are constantly judging each other's positions in the world,"
Victor said. "If it looks like this administration is only going to last for
four years, you might see other countries continue to push along on climate and
not give up on the US just yet."

BODY:

                     Donald Trump is struggling to find new staff to work for
him because everyone thinks he is "crazy", a senior member of the US President's
Republican Party has said.

Michael Steele said potential White House employeeswere putoff by an environment
in which aides are "flying by the seat of their pants".

"The talent pool is shrinking, because who wants to sign up for crazy?" added Mr
Steele, who served as chairman of theRepublican National Committeebetween 2009
and 2011.

"Nobody wants to step into a situation where you're flying by the seat of your
pants and don't know whether what you just said will hold up from one news cycle
to the next," he told

The Hill

."Nobody is going to be lining up for positions with that much uncertainty."

Mr Steele has previously said that he does not believe Mr Trump will make it to
the end of his four-year term in office and that current Vice President Mike
Pence will be Commander in Chief by 2020.

His latest comments come as Mr Trump is rumoured to be mulling a shake-up of
White House staff after the resignation of his communications director, Mike
Dubke.

Mr Dubke had been in post for less than three months when hehanded in his
resignation in mid-May. But he agreed to stay on until after Mr Trump's trip to
the Middle East and Europe.

The US President's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is also reported to be at
risk of being replaced, having been blamed for many of the problems dogging the
administration.

Press Secretary Sean Spiceris also thought to beunder threat amid ongoing
criticism of his briefings to media, although some reports have suggested that
hecould keep his job butgive fewer briefings.

HEADLINE: There's only one 'right' decision on climate change



HIGHLIGHT: "Investors should not plough their money into stranded assets that
will openly endanger the rest of their portfolios, regardless of whether
President Trump pulls the US out of the Paris agreement.

 BODY:

 President Trump's Apprentice-style tweet four days ago on his imminent decision
on whether to pull the US out of 2015's historic Paris agreement should not keep
institutional investors on tenterhooks: even if Trump reneges on the agreement
(as he seems almost certain to do) and fully embraces fossil fuels, investors
should not follow him down that rabbit hole.


The question is not whether investors can turn a quick buck helping Trump Make
Coal Great Again they certainly can, with the right projects and under the right
circumstances. But the long-term damage of increasing investors' exposure to
stranded assets and the negative impact those assets will have on the rest of
their portfolios should give them pause.
It seems incredible to be revisiting this topic after 147 out of the 197
countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement have already ratified it,
but when the world's economic powerhouse and second-largest polluter threatens
to go back on its commitment, it's worth making clear just what's at stake.
For the planet, Trump's decision to quit Paris would almost certainly accelerate
an already catastrophic-looking scenario. As Michael Oppenheimer, professor of
geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, put it to
Bloomberg: "Four years of the Trump administration may have only modest
consequences, but eight years of bad policy would probably wreck the world's
chances of keeping [global] warming below the international target of 2 degrees
Celsius."
And for investors? As 282 of them, representing over $17 trillion of capital
(that's 17x the amount needed to fund President Trump's proposed infrastructure
plan), made clear in a recent letter to the G7 and G20 nations: "As long-term
institutional investors, we believe that the mitigation of climate change is
essential for the safeguarding of our investments."
That's the key bit that the Trump administration seems to be missing as it
contemplates turning back the clock that many of the investors needed to fund
the US's energy plans are simply not interested anymore in funding assets that
pose a material risk to their portfolios.
Take the insurance industry, for example. Late last year, ClimateWise, a group
of 29 of the world's insurers, found that the gap between the cost of natural
disasters and the amount insured has quadrupled to $100 billion a year since the
1980s. As a result, they concluded they had to use more of their $30 trillion
war chest to help mitigate not exacerbate the effects of climate change.
Equally importantly, investors are paying close attention to what's already in
their portfolios. As James McIntire, Washington State Treasurer from 2009 to
2017, wrote in The Hillthis week, "public fiduciaries [[#xfffd]€[#xfffd]] must
intervene with companies and investment managers in response to ESG issues [like
climate change] and demand standardised sustainability information".
He points to a recently approved climate disclosure proposal put forward by
CalPERS and the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds demanding
multinational Occidental Petroleum evaluate how its portfolio would withstand a
2-degree increase in global temperature as an example of the kind of scrutiny
portfolio assets are under.
McIntire's conclusion is unequivocal: "Climate change presents significant risks
that will affect the long-term financial viability of the capital markets. In
the absence of federal action, it's the fiduciary responsibility of public
pensions to press forward."
And that, in the end, is the clincher. Politicians may have the luxury of tunnel
vision, of making decisions based on short electoral cycles and narrow
constituencies; institutional investors, particularly pensions and insurers, do
not. If President Trump ends up making the wrong decision, they would do well to
keep their long-term fiduciary duties front and centre.

Trump over climate change;
'It is disappointing the Americans are pulling out' of Paris Agreement,Home
Secretary says

BYLINE: Ian Johnston

BODY:

Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, has expressed disappointment over reports that
Donald Trump plans to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate
change.

Ms Rudd, a former Climate Change Secretary, also said she hoped the UK could use
its influence with the US President to make sure America takes "the right step".

Theresa May has been silent on the issue despite the open criticism of Mr Trump
by other European leaders and a petition raised by Greenpeace urging her to
speak to the Republican billionaire.

Experts say Trump pulling out of Paris Agreement is 'serious mistake'

Ms Rudd filledin for the Prime Minister during the BBC's general election
leaders debate after Ms May's controversial decision not to take part.

"It is disappointing the Americans are pulling out," Ms Rudd said, after a
member of the audience asked how the panellists would respond to the expected
announcement.

"But I hope that we can use our relationship with President Trump and our close
relationship with the US to try and influence, to try to make sure that they
nevertheless take the right step."

Picking up on Ms Rudd's remark, Angus Robertson, the deputy SNP leader, said he
was "more than disappointed, I'm appalled that President Trump is walking away
from a global approach to one of the biggest challenges we face both at home and
abroad".

Labour leader Jeremy Corbynsaid the UK should "absolutely adhere" to the Paris
Agreement and also urge the US to do the same.

EU leaders snub Donald Trump as bloc brokers climate pact with China

In addition to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, he said the switch to
renewableswas also about "levels of air quality and air pollution in our cities,
which are not being addressed by this Government".

ClientEarth, a group of activist environmental lawyers, has twice successfully
taken the Government to court to force it to improve its plan to cut air
pollution and recently announced it would do the same again after Ministers
published their third attempt.

During last year's Conservative leadership contest, ultimately won by Ms May,
some saw Ms Rudd as a potential candidate but she decided not to run.

However she challenged then leading contender Boris Johnson to make clear he was
not a climate science denier, stressing how important she believed the issue
was.

Donald Trump doesn't believe in climate change

"When I consider who to back as leader of the Conservative party and future
Prime Minister, knowing where they stand on this issue, which is so important to
me and I think is so important to the whole country and to everyone here, will
be absolutely central to who I support," she said.

"And I will be very, very clear about that and very vocal in holding anybody to
account on that the getting the sort of commitment that will reassure all of
us."

HEADLINE: New York city will uphold Paris Agreement even if Donald Trump
withdraws, says Mayor Bill de Blasio;
Mayors of some of the US' largest cities vowto implement deal locally if it
loses federal support

BYLINE: Lizzie Dearden

BODY:

The mayor of New York has pledged that the city will continue its commitment to
the Paris Agreement even if Donald Trump abandons the historic accords.

Bill de Blasio is the latest in a growing line of mayors controlling some of
America's largest cities who have reinstated their commitment to fight climate
change locally.

"The President withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would be horribly
destructive for the planet, the country, and this city," he wrote on Twitter.

"President Trump should know that climate change is a dagger aimed straight at

"The Paris Accord was the biggest step forward we've taken in many years. It's
unconscionable for the president to step away from it.

"But we'll take matters into our own hands. I plan to sign an executive order
maintaining New York City's commitment to the Paris Agreement."

Mr Trump has not yet announced his decision but multiple reports say he has told
aides he will withdraw the US from the accords, following years of controversial
statements on climate change including calling global warming a "hoax".

Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angles, has urged Mr Trump to "embrace" the
Paris Agreement and was among more than 70 mayors who pledged to "forge ahead
even in the absence of federal support" with an open letter to the President.

The letter, sent in December, was signed by Mr Blasio, Mr Garcetti and the
mayors of cities including Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Orlando, San Francisco and
many more.

American allies around the world have sounded public warnings over the
consequences of withdrawing from the agreement, seeing nations including China
and Russia restate their commitments.

Li Keqiang, the Chinese Premier, said says fighting climate change is a "global
consensus [that is] not invented by China", in apparent reference to a 2012
tweet by Mr Trump where he claimed "global warming was created by and for the
Chinese" to damage American trade.

The US is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, responsible for
15 per cent of all emissions.

Mr Trump claimed he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways" on
Wednesday but theWhite House signalled that he was likely to decide on exiting
the global pact, fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges.

When signing the agreement last year, Barack Obama said it might one day become
viewed as the moment "we finally decided to save the planet".

'The Americans can't just leave the Climate Protection Agreement. He believes

them'

BYLINE: Lucy Pasha-Robinson

BODY:

EU leaders have launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump as he prepares to
announce his decision to remove the US from the Paris climate accord.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker accused the US President of
ignorance, claiming "he doesn't get close enough to the dossiers to fully
understand them."

Speaking in Berlin, he revealed it could take as long as three to four years to
leave the agreement, meaning the US would only be removed from the pact after
the next presidential election.

It comes as the bloc reached a historic pact with China to uphold the
international agreement to combat climate change in the face of Mr Trump's
expected retreat.

Beijing and Brussels have reportedly agreed to accelerate the shift away from
fossil fuels, according to documents seen by theFinancial Times.

Mr Trump is expected to announce whether he will follow through on his campaign
pledge to remove the US from the Paris accord on Thursday, after claiming during
the election race that global warming was a hoax aimed at weakening US industry.

Numerous reports, citing White House sources, have confirmed he is poised to
withdraw from the agreement - seen as one of his predecessor Barack Obama's
greatest achievements.

However Mr Juncker said exiting the agreement will be a more complicated process
than Mr Trump appears to believe.

"That's not how it works. The Americans can't just leave the Climate Protection
Agreement. Mr Trump believes that because he doesn't get close enough to the
dossiers to fully understand them," Mr Juncker said.

"This notion: 'I am Trump, I am American, America first and I'm going to get out
of it it,' that won't happen...the law is the law and it must be obeyed. Not
everything which is law and not everything in international agreements is fake
news and we have to comply with it."

European Council President Donald Tusk issued his own plea to the US leader,
urging him not to "change the (political) climate for the worse."

.@realDonaldTrump please don't change the (political) climate for the worse.

- Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) June 1, 2017

Plans to "forge ahead" with measures to "lead the energy transition" are
expected to be announced in a joint statement fromEU leaders and Chinese Premier
Li Keqiangin Brussels on Friday.

In a seeming dig at Mr Trump's position, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Hua Chunying said climate change is a "global challenge" no country can ignore.
However, she stopped short of naming the US.

China is the top emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, with the US trailing
close behind. Both were key to the 2015 Paris agreement, which was signed by 195
parties.

Donald Trump might be the dimmest President the US has ever had

Withdrawing from the Paris pact became a central message of the Trump
presidential campaign. He promised his "America First" policy would protect US
businesses from international interference, and claimed withdrawing from the
accord would save the US economy trillions of dollars.

The pact was the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change.
Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global
emissions of "greenhouse" gases.

These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that
scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more
frequent violent storms.

The US would join Nicaragua and Syria as the only non-participants if it
withdraws from the agreement.

HEADLINE: Russia backs the Paris agreement on climate change as Donald Trump set

'It goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to

BYLINE: Ian Johnston

BODY:

The Russian Government has said it supports the Paris Agreement on climate
change ahead of Donald Trump's expected announcement that he will withdraw the
US from the landmark accord.

The Kremlin also said the deal, which seeks to limit global warming to as close
to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible, would be less effective without the
participation of major countries, Reuters reported.

Several news media in the US have reported that Mr Trump plans to ditch the
Paris Agreement, which Barack Obama suggested might one day become viewed as the
moment "we finally decided to save the planet".

Speaking hours ahead of the US President's formal announcement, Kremlin

(Vladimir) Putin signed this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great
significance to it.

"At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this
convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants."

He was speaking as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there was an "international
responsibility" for countries to take action over climate change during a trip
to Europe for talks with European Union officials.

Mr Li did not mention the US or Mr Trump specifically, but he referenced an
infamous claim by the Republican billionaire that global warming was a hoax made
up by China.

"Fighting climate change is a global consensus, it's not invented by China," he
said.

In an unprecedented step, the European Union and China are to release a joint
statement in a sign of the increasing closeness between Brussels and Beijing -
and the widening divide between Brussels and Washington under Mr Trump.

"The EU and China consider climate action and the clean energy transition an
imperative more important than ever," it will say.

There is an "international responsibility" to fight climate change, China's

expected announcement that the US will withdraw from the historic Paris
Agreement.

Despite widespread reports of the US's imminent departure, Mr Li insisted there
was a "global consensus" on the issue.

In contrast, Theresa May was decidedly low-key about the prospect of the US
quitting the accord, saying it was "up to the President of the United States"
and refusing to agree it would be a "blow" to the supposed special relationship
between the US and UK.

He said China had "in recent years has stayed true to its commitment" to address
the issue - a hint that the US would pay a diplomatic price for signing up to an
international agreement, then abandoning it.

Beijing hadalso been "actively promoting the Paris Agreement and we were one of
the first countries to ratify the Paris agreement", Mr Li added.

He appeared to reference a past claim by Mr Trump that climate change was a

"Fighting climate change is a global consensus, it's not invented by China...
and we realise that this is a global consensus agreement and that as a big
developing nation we should shoulder our international responsibility," he said.

The Chinese Premier was meeting with senior European Union officials at a summit

The European Union and China plan to issue a joint statement - the first time
this has happened - pledging to fully implementation of the Paris Agreement.

It commits them to cutting back on fossil fuels, developing more green

"The EU and China consider climate action and the clean energy transition an
imperative more important than ever," the statement, by European Council
President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and
China's Li, will say.

"The increasing impacts of climate change require a decisive response."

Miguel Arias Canete, the European commissioner who has led climate talks with
Beijing, said of the Paris accord: "No one should be left behind, but the EU and
China have decided to move forward."

Donald Trump doesn't believe in climate change

Like Mr Li, he contrasted China's constancy on climate changewith the apparent
change of heart by the US.

"I have lots of trust in the Chinese. They are very tough negotiators but they
are very consistent with what they negotiate," Mr Canete said.

"At a moment in which the United States have doubts about the benefits of
remaining in the Paris agreement ... two major players [the EU and China] in the
climate arena declare that they are committed to the Paris agreement."

says Chris Spagnuolo

BYLINE: Maya Oppenheim

BODY:

A bloggerhas sparked outrage for accusing Rihanna of being overweight and
arguing the singer could encourage other women to gain weight.

Chris Spagnuolo, whose nickname is Spags, claimed the eight-time Grammy Award
winner looked like she was in a "sumo suit" and "pushing 180".

The journalist, who writes for sports and men's lifestyle blog

Barstools Sport

, said the Barbados-born singer's long-standing role as a fashion trendsetter
and tastemaker could mean the "hottest girls look like the humans in

Wall-E

and just in time for summer".

Wall-E

is a dystopian sci-fi animation film which explores consumerism, climate change
and obesity, where the humans are so overweight that they can barely move.

Writing in his fiercely criticised blog post "Is Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat
the Hot New Trend?" Mr Spagnulo, who calls himself "Straight Spags" on Twitter,
said: "It looks to me like Rihanna is rocking some new high key thiccness [sic].

"And based on what I've seen, that means it's time to worry if you're not a guy
who fancies himself a chubby chaser."

He added: "A world of ladies shaped like the Hindenburg loaded into one-piece
bathing suits may be on the horizon now that Rihanna is traipsing around out
there looking like she's in a sumo suit."

The remarks about Rihanna, one of the best-selling artists of all time who has
carved out a dedicated and eclectic fan base over the years, immediately
prompted outrage on Twitter. Critics heaped praise on the singer's body and
argued the comments were a "joke", "cruel", and "offensive".

One critic said: "I've yet to come across one male employee at barstool that
isn't shaped like a lump of raw dough so congratulations you played yourself."

Another said: "

Barstool

has always treated women like sh*t. It's gross, but nothing new. There are no
repercussions becausethis is what the site and readers want".

Mr Spagnuolo has now claimed he is being bullied, tweeting: "Rihanna fans did
not like my blog calling her fat and now I'm being cyber-bullied".

The founder of

Barstool Sports

, a satirical website which has previously been accused of sexism but has seen
its monthly traffic increase from 1.4 million unique viewers to eight million in
the last five years, has now taken down the blogpost and issued a faux
half-hearted apology for the comments.

Dave Portnoy said he did not think the post "was as bad as many are making it
out to be" and said he was only removing it because it was not funny enough.

Writing in a statement, he said: "There are just certain topics that you better
nail if you're gonna write about them because you know they are hot button
issues for us. So if you're gonna blog about Rihanna gaining weight you better
be funny as f***and you better make it bullet proof."

He added: "As I've said many times Spags wasn't originally hired to be a
personality at

Barstool

. He should not be writing blogs that we as a company end up having to defend.
And I've been doing this long enough to know that somewhere down the line this
blog will be dug up again and used as an example of our extreme sexism. Frankly,
that's not a hill I'm willing to die on. I'll choose a different guy and a
different blog to go to war for."

A representative for Rihanna did not immediately respond to request for comment.

HEADLINE: Facebook and Apple urge Donald Trump not to pull out of Paris
Agreement;
Twenty-five US companies including Apple, Facebook andGooglehave signed a letter
imploring Mr Trump not to exit the 2015 Paris climate accord

BYLINE: Miles Dilworth

BODY:

Twenty-five of the world's biggest corporationshave made a last-minute pitch to
President Donald Trump urging him not to reconsider plans to withdraw the United
States from a landmark international agreement on climate change.

Companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Unilever and Morgan
Stanley have signed a letter imploring Mr Trump not to exit the 2015 Paris
climate accord, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.

On Wednesday, Mr Trump said on Twitter that he would be announcing his decision
on the accord from the White House Rose Garden at 8pm BST on Thursday.

Elon Musk to quit Trump advisory role if US leaves Paris Agreement

White House sources said on Wednesday morning that Mr Trump will formally
withdraw the US from the deal, although NBC have reported that the President is
yet to reach a final decision.

The letter follows Tesla CEO Elon Musk's suggestion that he would quit his
advisory role on a White House business council if Mr Trump chose to exit the
deal.

It argues that "continued US participation in the agreement benefits US
businesses and the US economy in many ways".

According to the letter, the Paris Agreement creates jobs and growth by
"expanding markets for innovative clean technologies", while "strengthening
competitiveness" and reducing the potentially harmful impact that future climate
change may have on business.

"As other countries invest in advanced technologies and move forward with the
Paris Agreement, we believe the United States can best exercise global
leadership and advance US interests by remaining a full partner in this vital
global effort," the letter read.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that oil giant Exxon Mobil had also urged Mr
Trump to keep the US signed up to the accord, with chief executive officer
Daniel Woods arguing that policy goals "should be to reduce emissions at the
lowest cost to society".

In April, a group of 16 companies, including Shell and Walmart, also signed a
letter to Mr Trump expressing their support for the US's continued participation
in the agreement.

If Mr Trump does withdraw from the deal, it would put the US alongside Syria as
the only nation in the world that does not view climate change as a policy
issue. Nicaragua, the only other country not signed up to the accord, is not
involved because it does not believe the deal does enough to address climate
change.

As one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world, a US withdrawal
would represent a major blow to a deal that seeks to limit the worst effects of
climate change.

The White House has yet to detail plans of what process it would use to withdraw
from the agreement. If Mr Trump chooses to declare the deal a treaty and submit
it for a Senate ratification vote, it is thought that he may struggle to secure
enough votes to succeed.

HEADLINE: Antarctic sends message to Donald Trump about global warming in shape
of iceberg the size of Delaware;
Giant crack in ice shelf grew by 11 miles in just one week

BYLINE: Chris Mooney

BODY:

A long-growing crack in the Larsen C ice shelf, one of Antarctica's largest
floating platforms of ice, appears to be nearing its endgame.

Researchers with Project MIDAS, working out ofSwansea University and Aberystwyth
University in Wales and studying the shelf by satellites and through other
techniques, have released a new update showing that the crack grew a stunning 11
miles in the space of just one week between May 25 and May 31.

It now has just 8 miles to go before an iceberg roughly the size of Delaware
breaks free into the Southern Ocean.

"There appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away
completely," the researchers write.

Elsewhere in their post, they note that the crack has now curved towards the
front of the ice shelf and the ocean, meaning that the time when a major break
could occur "is probably very close."

The researchers have estimated that the section of ice set to break off could be
around 2,000 square miles in area. The US state of Delaware isn't much larger
than that.

"When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10 per cent of its
area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this
event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula," write
the Project MIDAS team.

"We have previously shown that the new configuration will be less stable than it
was prior to the rift, and that Larsen C may eventually follow the example of
its neighbour Larsen B, which disintegrated in 2002 following a similar
rift-induced calving event."

The prospect of an enormous iceberg afloat in the seas around Antarctica could
draw further attention to the threat of climate change at a time when President
Trump is considering whether to exit the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.

An ice shelf is the floating extension of a glacier that itself grows from the
land out into the ocean. The loss of a large iceberg from Larsen C would not
raise the sea level, since the ice is already afloat.

However, the thinning and loss of ice shelves leads glaciers to flow more
rapidly into the sea, and as ice is transferred from atop the land into the
water, sea levels will rise somewhat.

HEADLINE: Donald Trump's climate change plans rebuffed by Wall Street;
Activists hailed a vote by Exxon asa turning point in their decades-long
campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a
low-carbon economy

BYLINE: Ross Kerber

BODY:

Major investors put USindustry on notice on Wednesday that climate change
matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw
the United States from an international pact to fight global warming.

A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock, the world's
largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon
Mobilto share more information about how new technologies and climate change
regulations could impact the business of the world's largest publicly traded oil
company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 per cent of votes cast.

The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning
point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate
how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy.

With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said
UScorporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming
planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord,
as MrTrump promised during his presidential campaign.

"Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations," said Anne Simpson,
investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution.

She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them
switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 per cent
support.

"We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint," she said. Many top investors now
consider their votes on shareholder proposals "on merit, rather than considering
it a test of loyalty to management," she said.

Among Exxon's top investors, Vanguard Group and BlackRockopposed last year's
call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7
per cent of Exxon's shares, declined to comment on its voting this year.

A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about
6 per cent of Exxon shares, voted in favour of the climate resolution.

Filings showing their exact votes are not due for months. But both fund firms
and others have taken steps since last year to make it easier to support climate
resolutions.

A spokesman for Exxon's ninth-largest investor Northern Trust, Doug Holt, said
it voted in favour of the proposal, citing its own guidelines updated in 2016.

The vote from the street

The investment firms' approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among
their own investors, who have stuffed money into so-called "green" mutual funds
and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking.

Wall Street's priorities have shifted the terms of debate at a number of other
energy and utility companies. A majority of shareholders voting at Occidental
Petroleumand PPL called for similar reports on the risks of climate change.
Votes on two more of the measures are scheduled for 7 Juneat Devon Energyand at
Hess.

Michael Crosby, involved in corporate outreach for the Midwest Capuchin
Franciscans, a religious order, said Wednesday's vote was a rejection of Exxon's
arguments it already provides enough detail on its outlook.

"The Street is saying, you have to give better evidence," Mr Crosby said.

After the measure passed, Exxon chief executive officer Darren Woods said its
board would reconsider its climate communications.

The activists now face the task of maintaining alliances with leaders like
MrWoods who opposed their resolutions but who in some cases support the
195-nation Paris agreement. Exxon said in a 22 Marchletter to the White House
that the Paris deal is "an effective framework for addressing the risks of
climate change."

Trump had at least one ally at Exxon's meeting in Dallas, Steven Milloy of
Potomac, Maryland, who urged other investors to support his resolution that
would make it harder to file proposals like the one on climate change.

Milloy said management should show less concerns for climate issues, which he
called misplaced, and cited MrTrump as a model. "For the first time we have a
president who actively opposes climate hysteria," MrMilloy said.

According to Exxon, Mr Milloy's proposal received support from 1.6 per cent of
votes cast.

HEADLINE: Trump set to announce decision on climate agreement as experts say
withdrawal a 'serious mistake';
The US would join Nicaragua and Syria as the only non-participants if it
withdraws from the agreement

BYLINE: Mythili Sampathkumar

BODY:

World leaders, as well as heads of business and climate change activists, have
piled the pressure on US President Donald Trump to not make the "serious
mistake" of withdrawing from the global Paris climate change agreement - a key
element of attempts to curb the effects of climate change.

Numerous reports, citing White House sources, have said that Mr Trump is poised
to withdraw the US from the agreement. Having spent weeks refusing to be pushed
into a corner by allies from around the world, Mr Trump has said he will
announce his decision on Thursday afternoon.

The US is the second largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. If the US
pulls out it will be a major blow to the accord signed by nearly 200 countries
in December 2015 to lower emissions.

Donald Trump to 'withdraw US from Paris Agreement on climate change'

Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the Paris pact a central plank of his
presidential election campaign as part of his 'America First' policy of
protecting US businesses from international interference. Mr Trump has said the
accord would cost the US economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit.

However, in recent weeks Trump officials have sought to characterise Mr Trump's
views as "evolving" and even on Wednesday Mr Trump himself said he had been
hearing from "both sides". But his lack of commitment to the agreement has left
allies frustrated - with German Chancellor Angela Merkel particularly strident.

If Mr Trump announces a withdrawal he has two options. He can initiate a formal
withdrawal policy from the agreement which could take up to three years or he
can withdraw entirely from the UN climate change body that oversees the
agreement, which would be faster.

However, in Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed
withdrawal would take years, saying, "The Americans can't just leave the climate
protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't know the
details."

European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him "in clear,
simple sentences" during summit meetings with EU officials, Nato members and the
Group of Seven (G7) nations last week, Mr Juncker said. "It looks like that
attempt failed,"

"This notion, 'I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,'
that is not going to happen," Mr Juncker added.

Dr Rachel Cleetus, Lead Economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told

The Independent

that "what makes the Paris Agreement strong is the near-universal consensus."

However, Dr Cleetus remains somewhat optimistic despite what she called a
"serious mistake" on the part of the administration if and when they finally
release the details of the withdrawal.

She explained that market trends of increasing investment in renewable energy
cannot be ignored.

If Mr Trump announces a decision on Thursday it may be an attempt to outflank
China and the European Union who will seek on Friday to buttress the Paris
agreement. In a statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and
China will commit to full implementation of the accord, EU and Chinese officials
said.

Richard Gowan, a UN expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told

The Independent

that Mr Trump's "decision to withdraw from Paris is a grim signal that this
administration remains committed to undermining the UN system."

The White House's confirmation that Mr Trump is expected to make this decision
comes on the heels of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urging the US to
stay in, but also indicating that others would take its place as a leader on
addressing global warming.

Mr Trump "may not care, but he has just created an astonishing opportunity for
the Chinese to assert themselves in the UN system," Mr Gowan said.

The Sierra Club said a US withdrawal from the Paris deal would be a "historic
mistake." Friends of the Earth said the action would "sacrifice our planet to
the fossil fuel industry" and make America the world's "foremost climate
villain."

A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) shows that the world's economies could boost economic growth by nearly
three per cent by 2021 if they institute policies that would lower greenhouse
gas emissions. By 2050 that growth could reach up to five per cent.

New money in renewable energy topped new investments in the oil and gas sector
for the first time in 2015, reaching approximately $350bn.

President of Ceres, a sustainability non-profitthat works with large investors,
Mindy Lubber said that "overall there is nothing good about" Mr Trump's planned
withdrawal.

She is concerned that a withdrawal would send the "wrong economic signal."

But, she said there "is so much momentum" in states that investments will not
dry up or go abroad where there will be a more clear and consistent commitment
to clean energy.

She also said that cities and states are still committed to combating climate
change as well, even Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts,
Phil Scott of Vermont, and governors of the states that control 40 per cent of
the country's GDP.

Ms Lubber noted that over a thousand US companies and several multi-billion
dollar pension funds around the country have committed to taking their money
away from fossil fuels and moving towards more sustainable forms of energy.

Thanu Yakupitiyage, US communications director of climate advocacy group
350.org, said that US businesses "outside of the coal industry...from high tech,
like Google, Apple, and Facebook, to consumer facing brands like Best Buy and
Walmart" have expressed a commitment to "go green" because of consumer demand
and "the risks climate change poses to their supply chains; they understand that
clean energy is ultimately cheaper than fossil fuels."

Tesla's Elon Musk has threatened to quit White House advisory councils if the
president pulls out. Mr Musk - who heads the electric car maker - said: "I've
done all I can to advise directly" to Trump and through others in the White
House.

The potential for a quick and clear commitment to the Paris agreement by the US
has also been reduced by the fact that Mr Trump's advisers are split on the
issue.

Senior adviser Steve Bannon, who wants Trump to focus on actions that will rev
up his conservative political base, has long opposed it. Jared Kushner,
Trumpâ€[TM]s son-in-law and top adviser, has come to the view that the standards
set out in the agreement did not work for the U.S. economy and the question was
whether to try to change those standards within the agreement or pull out,
another senior administration official said.

The expected withdrawal flies in the face of the advice of some of the respected
Cabinet members like Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil CEO, and even his own daughter Ivanka.

Mr Mattis and others in the Department of Defence (DoD) have noted that the
Pentagon does a substantial amount of work addressing rising sea levels,
changing sea routes for warships due to melting glaciers, and the effects of
drought and floods on US national security interests.

Francesco Femia, Co-President of the Center for Climate and Security, a think
tank of senior retired military officers and national security experts told

The Independent

that Mr Mattis also thinks climate change is a problem that needs to be solved
by the whole of government, not just the DoD.

Climate change can impact military infrastructure, like bases in coastal areas
around the world.

It can also have an indirect impact through not just "political penalties, but
also strategic penalties," said Mr Femia.

A withdrawal would make "it difficult to cooperate with allies and partners on a
range of security issues," he said.

Though he felt Mr Mattis would continue the work of the agency, he explained
fighting and adapting to climate change is so important to allies in Nato, the
EU, and especially countries in the Asia Pacific region who are concerned about
increasing tensions in the South China Sea, that withdrawal "will not make DoD's
job easier."

It sends the signal that "

we don't care, we're not serious about addressing this global risk."

If leaders at the recent G7 summit intimated to Mr Trump that the US was crucial
to the success of the deal, it may have opened the door to exercise some
leverage and scale back commitments on emissions reductions.

The ripple effect of encouraging other countries, especially those relying on
cheap coal to develop their fledgling economies, to do the same could be
devastating to the planet.

HEADLINE: Humans 'ushering in sixth mass extinction - but it's not too late',
say scientists

BYLINE: IAN JOHNSTON ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT

BODY:

Humans are bringing about the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, according
to scientists writing in a special edition of the leading journal Nature.
Mammals, birds and amphibians are currently becoming extinct at rates comparable
to the previous five mass extinctions when "cataclysmic forces" - such as
massive meteorite strikes and supervolcano explosions - wiped out vast swathes
of life, including the dinosaurs.

The growing human population - which has increased by 130 per cent in the last
50 years and is set to rise to more than 10 billion by 2060 - and our increasing
demand for resources as we become wealthier is ramping up the pressure on the
natural world. Tens of thousands of species - including 25 per cent of all
mammals and 13 per cent of birds - are now threatened with extinction because of
over-hunting, poaching, pollution, loss of habitat, the arrival of invasive
species, and other human-caused problems. But the researchers said it was not
"inevitable" that this process would continue. There is still time for humans to
turn the situation around by protecting habitats, changing our diets to less
land-intensive food, and taking other forms of conservation.

In one of a series of papers in Nature, a team of international scientists
wrote: "The ever-increasing and unprecedented extent and impact of human
activities on land and in the oceans over the past few centuries has
dramatically reduced global biodiversity. There is overwhelming evidence that
habitat loss and fragmentation, over-exploitation of biological resources,
pollution, species invasions and climate change have increased rates of global
species extinctions to levels that are much higher than those observed in the
fossil record." And we are not immune from such problems.

This loss of biodiversity could "substantially diminish the benefits that people
derive from nature", they warned. In order to preserve such "ecosystem
services", policies should be designed to "secure the valuable and often
irreplaceable benefits of biodiversity for future generations, even under
conditions of rapid global change", the paper added.

Another paper painted a bleak picture of humans' long history of wiping out
other animals. "Human-influenced extinctions began when modern humans moved out
of Africa," it said. "Successive waves of extinctions in Australia (50,000 years
ago), North America and South America (10,000-11,000 years ago) and Europe
(3,000-12,000 years ago) were driven largely by a combination of hunting by
humans and natural climate change. By 3,000 years ago, Earth had lost half of
all terrestrial mammalian megafauna species (with a mass of more than 44kg) and
15 per cent of all bird species."

The researchers said that since 1500AD, human destruction of wildlife had
"accelerated". "Extinction rates for birds, mammals and amphibians are similar
at present to those of the five global mass-extinction events of the past 500
million years that probably resulted from meteorite impacts, massive volcanism
and other cataclysmic forces," they wrote. The paper said "urgent" action was
needed to ensure that "sufficient habitats will remain to preserve the viability
of ... species in the long term and to guarantee that such habitats are well
managed".

"All species could benefit from the intensification of current conservation
policies, as well as from policies that reduce underlying anthropogenic
threats," the paper added. "Developing and enacting such policies, however, will
require an unprecedented degree of engagement between stakeholders,
policymakers, natural scientists and social scientists. Earth is capable of
providing healthy diets for 10 billion people in 2060 and preserving viable
habitats for the vast majority of its remaining species. The benefits for
biodiversity and humanity of pursuing these goals are great, and with
forethought and timely action, these goals can be achieved."

HEADLINE: Trump 'poised to take US out of Paris Agreement'

BYLINE: IAN JOHNSTON AND MYTHILI SAMPATHKUMAR

BODY:

Donald Trump is to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on
climate change, White House sources have claimed.

The US is currently one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world,
so if President Trump was to pull the country out the landmark pact to reduce
such carbon emissions it would be a major blow to a deal that aims to help avert
the worst effects of climate change.

Following a number of reports in US media about the move, Mr Trump tweeted that
he would be announcing "my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days"
followed by his campaign slogan "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!".

The Axios news website said the sources had "direct knowledge of the decision"
made by the Republican billionaire, who has previously described global warming
as a hoax perpetrated by China - also a large polluter.

As President, Mr Trump can withdraw from Paris on his own authority. The reason
it was called an "agreement'" was to enable Barack Obama to use the president's
executive power to ratify it without having to seek the permission of the
Republican-controlled Congress, which must ratify any international treaties.

The US delegation had to negotiate for several hours over complicated legal
language the day the agreement was signed in December 2015. Part of the issue
was that other countries were very concerned about the exact situation the world
is now: a post-Obama administration catering to climate deniers in the US
Congress that would be able to legally withdraw.

The decision to withdraw from the climate accord was influenced by a letter from
22 Republican US senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, calling
for an exit, Axios reported.

Mr Trump has ignored the advice of a string of senior advisers, including his
own daughter Ivanka Trump, Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson, who all advocated keeping a seat at the table.

Mr Mattis and others in the Department of Defence have noted that the Pentagon
does a substantial amount of work addressing rising sea levels, changing sea
routes for warships due to melting glaciers, and the effects of drought and
floods on US national security interests.

During his campaign, Mr Trump had vowed to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100
days of becoming President, as part of an effort to bolster US oil and coal
industries. That promise helped rally supporters sharing his scepticism of
global efforts to police US carbon emissions. However, he later said he would
take his time to understand the issue of the Paris agreement before deciding
whether to pull out.

The Trump administration must now decide whether to begin the three-year
withdrawal process stipulated by the Paris Agreement. or ditch the underlying
United Nations treaty which would speed up the process.

Such a move would be a sign that he plans to further cut environmental
regulations and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enacted by Mr Obama.
Mr Trump's proposed federal budget includes major cuts to the tune of nearly 30
per cent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), however his planned $54bn
increase to defence spending may cover some climate-related programmes depending
on if discretion is granted to the Pentagon.

He also wants to cut the budget of the US Coast Guard, the maritime security
agency, by a significant amount. The agency's work also encompasses ocean
conservation, marine life and endangered species protection, and some research.

The report of the apparent decision comes hours after the UN Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres urged the US to remain within the Paris Agreement, which seeks
to limit global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible.

So far the world's average temperature has risen by just under one degree
because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.

Germany, France and other leading nations have expressed frustration with Mr
Trump's stance on climate change. Even Pope Francis tried to persuade the US
President during his recent visit to the Vatican by presenting him with a papal
letter, or encyclical, the Pontiff wrote in 2015 regarding the need to address
the multi-faceted issue of climate change.

Supporters of the climate pact are concerned that a US exit could lead other
nations to weaken their commitments or also withdraw, softening an accord that
scientists have said is critical to avoiding the worst impacts of climate
change.

Canada, the European Union, and China have said they will honour their
commitments to the pact even if the United States withdraws. A source told
Reuters that India had also indicated it would stick by the deal.

Mr Trump's attitude toward the agreement prompted German Chancellor Angela
Merkel to say that Europeans can no longer rely on the US.

"If this is true, it is a big setback. Then, we must find partners to continue,
because this work must not stop," Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila told
parliament.

Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations,
said in a statement that this was a "short-sighted and dangerous decision". They
said it "will be met by opposition around the world: from ordinary people, to
scientists, and political leaders - making the US a global outcast".

HEADLINE: Ditching the Paris accord would make the world a more dangerous place

BYLINE: IAN JOHNSTON ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT

BODY:

One day, people might come to view the Paris Agreement on climate change as "the
moment that we finally decided to save our planet", Barack Obama optimistically
opined as the US and China jointly ratified the historic accord. But, just eight
months later, it appears that dream is in tatters with multiple reports that
Donald Trump will rip up the deal which committed countries to slashing carbon
emissions in an effort to prevent global warming from entering particularly
dangerous territory.

It appears certain that the world's second biggest source of greenhouse gases
will thumb its nose at most of the rest of the world, scientists and people not
given to bizarre conspiracy theories. Bizarre conspiracy theories like it's all
a hoax perpetrated by China - that one's from Donald Trump - or a plot by the
United Nations to create a world government - Lamar Smith, the Republican chair
of the House of Representatives' Science Committee. Anti-Science Committee, more
like.

This is definitely bad news, but perhaps not for the reasons you might think.
The switch to a low-carbon economy has gained a life of its own. As the price of
renewable energy, particularly solar and onshore wind, has tumbled, the process
is increasingly being driven by market forces as much as well-meaning
politicians.

US states and cities have already started ramping up efforts to go green in the
wake of Trump's election. And the President's oft-repeated plan to "Make America
Great Again" by reviving the coal industry may prove more difficult than he
believes, largely because of competition from cheaper shale gas. So four years
of a climate science-denying Trump administration might not actually be so bad
for international efforts to limit global warming.

The real danger could come from the geopolitical fallout. During Trump's
disastrous trip to Europe, his infamous alpha-male handshake met its match in
Emmanuel Macron when the newly elected French squeezed so hard the US President
was forced to publicly concede in front of the cameras. He was also ridiculed
after childishly pushing the Prime Minister of Montenegro out the way so he
could be at the front of a group of Nato leaders. Trump found himself publicly
upbraided by Angela Merkel, largely because of his views on climate change, and
then Macron struck again, pretending to greet Trump before swerving at the last
moment to speak to Merkel first, two other people, before finally acknowledging
the "Leader of the Free World".

Trump doesn't like being teased. His face at a White House Correspondents'
Dinner as the then President Obama ridiculed him over the "birther" conspiracy
was evidence enough of that. In fact, it's not totally implausible to believe
that getting back at the "nasty people who teased me" could have swung what was
said to be a finely balanced decision on the Paris Agreement.

Heavyweight figures in his administration: his own daughter Ivanka Trump,
Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson - the former
boss of oil giant Exxon - are believed to have argued that the US would pay too
high a diplomatic price for quitting the accord. Countries who "go back on their
word" can find it more difficult to cut new deals with other states, something
Trump, who regards himself as an arch-dealmaker, would probably have taken
seriously. A US withdrawal from the Paris deal would further widen the rift
between the US and European Union, potentially causing problems within Nato,
which Moscow-friendly Trump once described as "obsolete" although he later
reined back on that assessment.

It could also spark a trade war with talk of US exports being hit by carbon
taxes to compensate for the Trump administration's lack of action to reduce
emissions. And this suggestion has not just come from the usual suspects - the
former conservative French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was among those to make
it.

This would pit the US - along with fellow Paris refuseniks Syria and Nicaragua -
against nearly 200 countries who have signed up to the Paris accord. It could
force oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and even post-Brexit
Britain to choose sides. So it's perhaps understandable that Theresa May has
been maintaining a "pact of silence" over Trump, Paris and the rapidly rising
temperature, both meteorologically and diplomatically speaking.

After all, things could get really rather messy.

HEADLINE: The hard right of the Tory party is in charge right now

BYLINE: CHUKA UMUNNA

BODY:

The Prime Minister called this general election to seek a mandate for her
Government's approach to Brexit. Voters must "make me stronger" she said, for
when she goes to Brussels to negotiate with other European leaders. It was a
message she repeated again in her speech on Brexit yesterday, intended as a
relaunch of her flailing and chaotic election campaign. But a bigger Tory
mandate would empower their instinct to carry out an extreme Brexit that would
leave working people worse off. A look at the past statements of pro-Leave
Tories - especially those in the current cabinet - who are driving May's agenda
lifts the lid off a Pandora's Box of unpleasant right-wing policies that would
represent nothing less than a raid on the least fortunate, both in Britain and
abroad.

May peddles bromides about "building on" workers' rights after we leave the EU,
and standing up for those who are "just about managing". But her record suggests
otherwise, with her long history of voting against life-changing legislation
such as the national minimum wage, the 2010 Equality Act, and the repeal of
Section 28. With her Government intent on taking Britain out of the structure of
employment regulations guaranteed by the single market and European Court of
Justice (ECJ), workers' rights are up for grabs, including directives on working
hours, equal treatment for agency workers, and ECJ judgments on holiday pay.
Priti Patel has spoken of "halving" the "burden" of this regulation. Liam Fox
called workplace rights "intellectually unsustainable", while Boris Johnson
demanded they "scrap the social chapter".

Combined with this Government's history of reducing taxes for the rich and big
corporations, while cutting the benefits that working people rely on, it is
clear that a Tory Government with an increased majority will be heavily tempted
to slash rights at work. This is the basis of the "alternative economic model"
Philip Hammond has spoken of if we leave the European Union with no deal at all.

The extreme Tory Brexiteers likewise pose a threat to our National Health
Service. Leave campaigners now in the Cabinet promised that Brexit would be the
saving of our NHS, plastering their £350m-a-week promise down the side of that
infamous red bus. But earlier this year, each and every one of these Tories
lined up to vote against my amendment to the Article 50 Bill which would have
delivered this money. After seven years of callous Tory Government, it is clear
we cannot trust them on the NHS - especially when Johnson, Fox and David Davis
have a history of calling for charges, cuts and privatisations in our health
service. The Government's own forecasters predict a £58bn black hole in the
budget as a direct consequence of Brexit. This will mean less money, not more,
for an NHS already starved of funds.

It is not just British people who will suffer as a result of a hard Tory Brexit,
but the very poorest around the world. Having an International Development
Secretary who previously called for the abolition of that very department might
seem like a rejected plotline from The Thick Of It, but in the case of Patel it
is all too true. Fox and Davis have both called for the scrapping of the target
to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on aid - a target that has directed billions into
vital programmes to reduce extreme poverty and educate women and girls. When
that £58bn black hole begins to grow, Tory backbenchers will undoubtedly demand
that this symbol of Britain's commitment to the poorest of the world be junked.

Climate change, which has a greater impact on the developing world than anywhere
else, is another target on the hard right's hit list. Lord Lawson, one of the
intellectual godfathers of the pro-Brexit movement, chairs the Global Warming
Policy Foundation which denies the scientific consensus on climate change.
Johnson and Davis have aired doubts about man-made climate change, while our
current Environment Secretary admitted upon being appointed that she had to ask
"is climate change real?". When we lose the protection of EU emissions targets
and environmental protections, there will be no guarantee that such protections
will be continued.

This is not an impossible scenario. The extreme right of the Conservative Party
is in the intellectual driving seat of their Government. For them, Brexit is
about much more than our future relationship with the European Union; it is a
means to an end - a harsh, libertarian society that works for the wealthy and
pulls the rug out from underneath the most vulnerable. They destroyed David
Cameron, and May's entire political strategy is based on giving them red meat so
they do not do the same to her. Furthermore, in our desperation for trade deals
with the likes of Donald Trump's America, it is quite possible that
environmental and worker protections will be given up at the behest of foreign
corporations. At this election, it is vital that the Tories are not only
prevented from pursuing an extreme hard Brexit, but stopped from changing
Britain into a nasty, uncaring country.

HEADLINE: May branded 'weak' for ducking election debate

BYLINE: JOE WATTS POLITICAL EDITOR

BODY:

Theresa May's refusal to take part in a live TV election debate come under fire
from her political rivals last night, who accused her of "weakness" and taking
the British public for granted. Seven politicians took to the stage to fight it
out yesterday, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's late decision to attend
serving to highlight Ms May's absence further.

The Prime Minister's no-show was repeatedly raised with her stand in, Home
Secretary Amber Rudd, taking flak from rivals over the Conservative party's
record. The contest followed a difficult week for the Tories who have seen their
poll lead shrink in the wake of Ms May's U-turn on social care.

In the live BBC debate, the party leaders and Ms Rudd clashed over benefits,
Brexit, foreign policy, climate change and the arms trade - but Ms May's absence
was hammered home by the other participants at the beginning and end of the
night.

Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood opened by claiming Ms May "won't turn up to these
debates because her campaign of soundbites is falling apart." The SNP's
Westminster leader Angus Robertson said it showed Ms May was "weak and wobbly",
while the audience clapped when Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Ms May
"can't be bothered" to turn up. He added: "You're not worth Theresa May's time.
Don't give her yours."

Ms May refused to take part in head-to-head debates, which have also involved
Ukip leader Paul Nuttall and the Greens' Caroline Lucas, and was said to be
catching up on Government business while yesterday's 90-minute programme took
place. Meanwhile, it was reported that Ms Rudd decided to keep her commitment to
take part despite her father having died two days earlier.

Mr Corbyn - whose message was that the UK needs an economy that "works for all"
- did not mention the Prime Minister's absence, with a Labour source claiming it
"spoke for itself". He did engage Ms Rudd in the standout early clash of the
night, however.

In a heated exchange over disability benefits and the rising use of food banks,
he said: "Amber Rudd seems so confident that this is a country at ease with
itself - have you been to a food bank? Have you seen people sleeping around our
train stations?"

Hitting back, she repeatedly accused Mr Corbyn of relying on a "magic money
tree" to fund his election pledges. Ms Rudd added: "I just have to take on some
of Jeremy Corbyn's fantasy economics. He has this money-tree wish list in his
manifesto. It's very easy to think about how you spend money, It's much harder
to think about how you raise money."

In another notable clash, Ms Lucas claimed to not know how Ms Rudd slept at
night, while the Government she is part of sells more arms around the world than
almost every other country. Addressing the Home Secretary directly, she said:
"My question is this really, why is Britain the second biggest arms dealer in
the world? Why are we selling to 22 of the 30 countries on the Government's own
human rights watch list?

"Why do we make ten times more in arms sales to Saudi Arabia than we gave to
Yemen in aid? I genuinely wonder how you sleep at night knowing those figures."

The Government has recently approved £3.5bn worth of arms export licenses to
Saudi Arabia and a stream of British ministers have visited the kingdom to
solicit trade despite its ongoing involvement in the bombing campaign in Yemen.
In response, the Home Secretary said a strong arms industry was important to
national defence.

Despite attacks from all sides, Ms Rudd sought to emphasise the Tory campaign
message that Mr Corbyn, backed by some of the smaller parties, could form a
"coalition of chaos" aimed at preventing Ms May from returning to No10 after 8
June.

"You have heard the squabbling and discord of disagreement here tonight," she
said. "You have seen the coalition of chaos here in action but in the quiet of
the polling booth you have a clear choice."

But the Home Secretary was laughed at by the audience as she called for people
to "judge us on our record", she then came under pressure over the so-called
"dementia tax" shake-up of social care, the plan to axe the pension triple-lock
and means-test the winter fuel payment worth up to £300 for elderly people.

Mr Farron said Ms May's refusal to set out what the cap on social care costs
would be or who would lose their winter fuel payments meant she was asking
voters for a "blank cheque".

HEADLINE: Trump 'poised to take US out of Paris Agreement'

BYLINE: IAN JOHNSTON AND MYTHILI SAMPATHKUMAR

BODY:

Donald Trump is to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on
climate change, White House sources have claimed. The US is currently one of the
largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world, so if President Trump was to
pull the country out the landmark pact to reduce such carbon emissions it would
be a major blow to a deal that aims to help avert the worst effects of climate
change.

Following a number of reports in US media about the move, Mr Trump tweeted that
he would be announcing "my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days"
followed by his campaign slogan "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!". President Donald
Trump says his plans for the Paris climate accord will be known "very soon."

The Axios news website said the sources had "direct knowledge of the decision"
made by the Republican billionaire, who has previously described global warming
as a hoax perpetrated by China - also a large polluter.

As President, Mr Trump can withdraw from Paris on his own authority. The reason
it was called an "agreement'" was to enable Barack Obama to use the president's
executive power to ratify it without having to seek the permission of the
Republican-controlled Congress, which must ratify any international treaties.

The US delegation had to negotiate for several hours over complicated legal
language the day the agreement was signed in December 2015. Part of the issue
was that other countries were very concerned about the exact situation the world
is now: a post-Obama administration catering to climate deniers in the US
Congress that would be able to legally withdraw.

The decision to withdraw from the climate accord was influenced by a letter from
22 Republican US senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, calling
for an exit, Axios reported.

Mr Trump has ignored the advice of a string of senior advisers, including his
own daughter Ivanka Trump, Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson, who all advocated keeping a seat at the table.

Mr Mattis and others in the Department of Defence have noted that the Pentagon
does a substantial amount of work addressing rising sea levels, changing sea
routes for warships due to melting glaciers, and the effects of drought and
floods on US national security interests.

During his campaign, Mr Trump had vowed to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100
days of becoming President, as part of an effort to bolster US oil and coal
industries. That promise helped rally supporters sharing his scepticism of
global efforts to police US carbon emissions. However, he later said he would
take his time to understand the issue of the Paris agreement before deciding
whether to pull out.

The Trump administration must now decide whether to begin the three-year
withdrawal process stipulated by the Paris Agreement. or ditch the underlying
United Nations treaty which would speed up the process.

Such a move would be a sign that he plans to further cut environmental
regulations and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enacted by Mr Obama.
Mr Trump's proposed federal budget includes major cuts to the tune of nearly 30
per cent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), however his planned $54bn
increase to defence spending may cover some climate-related programmes depending
on if discretion is granted to the Pentagon.

He also wants to cut the budget of the US Coast Guard, the maritime security
agency, by a significant amount. The agency's work also encompasses ocean
conservation, marine life and endangered species protection, and some research.

The report of the apparent decision comes hours after the UN Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres urged the US to remain within the Paris Agreement, which seeks
to limit global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible.

So far the world's average temperature has risen by just under one degree
because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.

Germany, France and other leading nations have expressed frustration with Mr
Trump's stance on climate change. Even Pope Francis tried to persuade the US
President during his recent visit to the Vatican by presenting him with a papal
letter, or encyclical, the Pontiff wrote in 2015 regarding the need to address
the multi-faceted issue of climate change.

Supporters of the climate pact are concerned that a US exit could lead other
nations to weaken their commitments or also withdraw, softening an accord that
scientists have said is critical to avoiding the worst impacts of climate
change.

China and the European Union will seek on Friday to save an international pact
against climate change that US President Donald Trump appears to be set to pull
out of. The European Commission president yesterday said that it was the "duty
of Europe" to stand up to the US if President Donald Trump decides to pull his
country out of the Paris climate change accord. Jean-Claude Juncker said that
"the Americans can't just get out of the agreement," adding that "it takes three
to four years" to pull out.

Premier Li Keqiang will meet top EU officials at a summit in Brussels and in a
statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and China will commit
to full implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement, EU and Chinese officials
said.

Richard Gowan, a UN expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told
The Independent that Mr Trump's "decision to withdraw from Paris is a grim
signal that this administration remains committed to undermining the UN system."
Mr Trump "may not care, but he has just created an astonishing opportunity for
the Chinese to assert themselves in the UN system."

Mr Trump's attitude toward the agreement prompted German Chancellor Angela
Merkel to say that Europeans can no longer rely on the US.

"If this is true, it is a big setback. Then, we must find partners to continue,
because this work must not stop," Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila told
parliament.

Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations,
said in a statement that this was a "short-sighted and dangerous decision". They
said it "will be met by opposition around the world: from ordinary people, to
scientists, and political leaders - making the US a global outcast".

HEADLINE: Allocators Condemn Trump's Paris Withdrawal

BYLINE: Staff



HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement despite pressure from
institutional investors to stand by the global climate change treaty.

 BODY:

President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the United States would withdraw
from the Paris Agreement, an international accord on climate change that had
been supported by many institutional investors.

In a speech at the White House Rose Garden, Trump said the U.S. would
immediately cease its compliance with the climate treaty, claiming that the pact
was &very unfair& to the U.S. and citing economic concerns about its effect on
jobs.

Last month, 217 institutional investors representing $15 trillion urged world
leaders to stand by the Paris Agreement, which requires nations to reduce their
carbon emissions in an attempt to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
The group included pension funds, insurers, foundations, and asset management
firms, among them the California Public Employees& Retirement System and
Sweden&s AP funds.

&CalPERS supports the Paris Agreement because it makes financial sense,& Chief
Executive Officer Marci Frost said in a statement made after Trump&s speech. &As
a global investor and as fiduciaries focused on the long-term sustainability of
our investments, we will continue to support the Paris Agreement on climate
change.&

The U.S. had committed to the climate treaty last year under President Barack
Obama. By pulling out, the U.S. will be one of the only nations to reject the
Paris Agreement, which had been the first legally binding global pact to fight
climate change.

Trump said that the U.S. would soon begin negotiations with other nations either
to re-enter the accord on new terms or develop a new climate treaty.

&Despite recent federal actions to withdraw the United States from the Paris
Climate Change Agreement, CalSTRS remains steadfastly focused on our commitment
to advancing long-term sustainability on a global scale,& Jack Ehnes, CEO at
California State Teachers& Retirement System, said in a statement.

&As a powerful institutional investor committed to increasing climate change
awareness, CalSTRS acknowledges that environmental risks, both current and those
projected over the next 10 to 25 years, absolutely must be considered as part of
our fiduciary responsibility,& he said.

The risks to the environment warrant mitigating strategies driven by active
shareholders, like CalSTRS, to hold portfolio companies accountable and propel
them through positive change, according to Ehnes.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer also sees harm in the president&s
decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, vowing to fight back and work
towards a sustainable future in a low carbon economy.

&This Administration has once again put itself on the wrong side of history.
Man-made climate change is real, the science is incontrovertible, and the threat
to our planet is undeniable,& Stringer said in a May 31 statement on Trump&s
plan to back out of the accord. &If Washington works to turn back the clock on
the environment, cities like New York will continue to stand up and protect it.&

HEADLINE: Fundraising for Renewable Resources Exceeds Conventional Energy

BYLINE: Alicia McElhaney



HIGHLIGHT: A Preqin report shows fundraising for conventional energy has fallen
significantly from its 2015 peak.

 BODY:

Investor interest in renewable energy is swelling less than two years after
Paris Agreement was signed to protect the environment globally.

Renewables-focused funds have raised $5 billion this year, outstripping
fundraising targeting conventional energy for the first time, according to a
Preqin report Wednesday. Fundraising for conventional energy has fallen
significantly from its $38 billion peak in 2015, when renewable funds attracted
$13.8 billion globally.

Trump&s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, an
historic international accord on climate change that world leaders adopted in
2015, isn&t likely to stop allocators from investing in renewable energy.

&As managers, when you look at renewable energy it&s less about policy,& Tom
Carr, head of real assets products at Preqin, said by phone. &Now it&s sort of
more about the economics behind it. Investments in renewable energy actually
make business sense now.&

Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and
Financial Analysis said he views renewable energy investing as a race horse race
already long out of a gate. And while &Trump says we don&t want to be part of
this race,& his move likely won&t have an impact on investing in renewables,
Sanzillo said.

Institutional investors were quick to denounce the president&s decision last
week, with California Public Employees& Retirement System and the California
State Teachers& Retirement System reiterating they stood by the Paris Agreement.
Last month 217 institutional investors representing $15 trillion urged world
leaders to stand by the accord, requiring nations to reduce carbon emissions to
keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

The median net internal rate of return from renewable energy investments is just
under 5 percent since 2003, less than half the 10.3 percent median net IRR from
nonrenewable sources, according to Carr. Still, what matters more is that
renewable energy investors are now finally seeing returns. And while investments
in nonrenewable energy sources, like oil, natural gas or coal have higher
returns, Carr noted that these carry a greater risk. This is because renewable
sources of energy tend to be more predictable, which makes expected returns more
stable, he added.

Sanzillo agreed, noting that renewable energy investments are starting to
outperform their targets.

&On the equities side, you&re seeing investments that are above what investment
performance targets are,& Sanzillo said. &On the listed equity market, there&s
early evidence that the companies themselves that are involved in renewables are
showing profits that are comparable and usually better than power generation
utilities.&

According to the Preqin report, most allocators favor an investment mix of
renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. As a result, fundraising for
traditional nonrenewable resources fell 41 percent last year to $22.3 billion
while interest in renewable energy has picked up.

The majority of interest in renewable energy investing comes from Europe,
according to Preqin. Still, the Paris Agreement may lead emerging markets like
China and India to increase their renewable energy investments in the coming
years.

&More investors will be coming into the renewable space,& Carr said. &But I
don&t see conventional energy going anywhere right now.&

HEADLINE: Banks "" at the Fed's Urging "" Back Community Investing

BYLINE: Imogen Rose-Smith



HIGHLIGHT: Hospital endowments, foundations, and even banks are among those
committing capital to community programs, which the San Francisco Federal
Reserve endorsed in a new book.

 BODY:

Over the past decade a quiet revolution has been taking place in philanthropy.
Now its effects are starting to creep into the investment offices of foundations
and endowments, as well as the boardrooms and investment advisory businesses of
banks and other financial market participants. Among the key players leading the
charge: the U.S. Federal Reserve.

This week the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco published a new book, along
with the Nonprofit Finance Fund, titled What Matters: Investing In Results to
Build Strong, Vibrant Communities . The book makes the case that philanthropy
should be focused on outcomes, not outputs & in other words, what the overall
effect of a program is, rather than whether a certain initiative achieves its
prescribed mandate. This could mean in the case of, say, a homeless shelter, a
shift from counting beds occupied (an output) to helping homeless people get off
the streets and into full-time housing, as well as tackling the underlying cause
of their homelessness (an outcome). A growing number of not-for-profits and
their leaders, key among them Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation,
are advocating for this type of approach to both grant giving and investing in
social problems.

&The challenge for philanthropy is that we have to interrogate the way we do
business,& Walker said, speaking this week at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in downtown Manhattan at an event organized to introduce the San Francisco
Fed&s new book.

Andrew Plepler, global head of ESG (environment, social responsibility and
corporate governance) at Bank of America, said at the event that giving back to
the community and interest in community investing have gone from a corporate
responsibility function to a business interest.

&Institutional investors start tracking it as a proxy for good management,& he
said. For banks today, he said, supporting community-based initiatives and other
social and environmental priorities such as climate change is &enlightened
self-interest.&

On the surface, this change in philanthropy might not appear to have much to do
with the Federal Reserve & but it does, in part because of the Community
Reinvestment Act. Passed in 1977, the legislation stipulates that banks that are
covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. must allocate a portion of their
capital to investing in the communities in which they operate, including low-
and mid-income communities. The financial crisis of 2008 increased the number of
institutions subject to the Community Reinvestment Act after banks such as
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become deposit-taking
institutions.

Another reason why these changes matter to for-profit actors is money. That&s
because an outcomes-based approach to tacking social problems is more easily
adapted into investment opportunities.

&The time is ripe for a new type of collaboration,& writes former Massachusetts
governor Deval Patrick, who joined Bain Capital in 2015, in the book&s foreword.
&Business has a role & and a profitable one at that.& Last year Patrick launched
the Bain Capital Double Impact fund, a private equity fund focused on achieving
market rate returns and having a social or environmental impact.

In 2014 JP Morgan Chase & Co. announced a $100 million commitment to inner-city
Detroit. The city & blighted by poverty, a lack of jobs, and massive pension
debts & had filed for bankruptcy in 2013. This May JP Morgan announced that its
investment had been so successful it was upping its commitment to $150 million
by 2019. The bank has made clear it sees its $150 million commitment as an
investment, not a gift.

Banks are now starting to do more than just commit their own balance sheets to
community investing. There is, in particular, a demand from wealthy individuals
who want to invest in ways that make money but also have good social and
environmental out comes, an approach that has been termed impact investing.

&The interest in impact investing is enormous,& says Plepler. Bank of America
has $15 billion of its wealth management assets invested in what it identifies
as impact investing.

At Ford, Walker has been leading a charge to get his $12.5 billion foundation to
commit some of its investment dollars to impact investing in projects aligned
with the foundation&s core mission of social justice. Walker&s efforts are
starting to have some effect; in March, Ford announced that it would be
committing $1 billion of its endowment to impact investing.

One core group for which community-based investing may increasingly have some
appeal is hospitals. Tyler Norris, a former vice president of total health
partnerships at Kaiser Permanente, coauthored a chapter in the San Francisco
Fed&s book on health care in the community. Speaking at the New York Fed event,
Norris, who is now the chief executive of the Oakland, California&based
not-for-profit Well Being Trust, urged stakeholders to encourage hospitals to
invest their endowment assets into developing more healthy communities.

HEADLINE: Why Al Gore Dreams of The Electric Bus

BYLINE: Imogen Rose-Smith



HIGHLIGHT: Al Gore's Generation Investment Management and BMW's venture capital
arm have announced an investment in an electric bus company.

 BODY:

Generation Investment Management and BMW i Ventures, the venture capital arm of
the German car maker, are leading a $55 million, sixth round of funding for
electric bus developer Proterra.

The financing commitment to the company follows a $140 million, series 5 round
in January. The fresh capital will be used to increase production at Proterra&s
manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Los Angles, and bolster research
and development efforts.

The Burlingame, California-based company has sold 400 buses to 38
municipalities, universities and commercial transit agencies in 20 states around
the U.S. Generation Investment Management, co-founded in 2004 by former U.S.
Vice President Al Gore, seeks to invest in transformational, sustainable,
innovations that are disrupting the global economy.

&Proterra is going to be an extremely important part of transportation
infrastructure in the future,& said Zach Barasz, a partner with BMW i Ventures,
which has &500 million ($560 million) from BMW to invest in new
transportation-related technologies. &We see Proterra as a clean technology
leader in the market.&

Barasz added that the company has &done pretty incredible work around building
an impressive& intellectual property portfolio, and his group was particularly
struck by the amount of traction and the amount of positive momentum& they have
generated.

The $15 billion London-based sustainable investment firm Generation Investment
Management is making the Proterra financing part of its Growth Equity fund, a
private-markets pool that funds companies with new technologies in the later
stages.

&We have been building up a thesis around the transition to a sustainable
economy; around energy transition and mobility transition and a food
transition,& said Colin Le Duc, a founding partner at Generation and member of
the growth equity fund team.

The urban and personal mobility story has been &a very big important theme for
us for many years.&

Like BMW i Ventures, Generation Investment Management, which was co-founded Gore
and David Blood, a former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, was impressed by Proterra&s management, as well as where it is in
its development cycle.

Gore, who was the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate for &informing the world of
the dangers posed by climate change,& serves as chairman of Generation,
according to the firm&s website.

Electric transportation is an increasingly popular area for investors. Shares of
Tesla, the Palo Alto, California-based electric car maker founded by Elon Musk
has been on a tear since its November 2016 merger with Musk&s rooftop solar
panel company, SolarCity. Even with large tech company stocks starting to sell
off, a recent Morgan Stanley research report still saw a bull case for Tesla
that would put the stock, which closed Monday at about $359, as high as $511 a
share.

Proterra CEO Ryan Popple, who joined the firm in 2014, is a Tesla alum. He views
the last 18 months particularly important for Proterra. They were &quite
transformational from a business perspective in terms of the progression we made
with the tech and market growth.&

The company made developments in battery storage technology, making it possible
for its buses to drive for well over 200 miles before needing to recharge. Last
year, a test bus made it 600 miles on a single charge, Popple said.

Unlike the personal car market, Proterra is also a play on another part of the
sustainable economy puzzle & public transportation. &The personal car market is
really not where transportation is going in the 21st Century,& says Popple. The
future & both for getter efficiency and environmental reasons & lies in public
transportation.

Energy efficient transportation is going to be an important part of reaching the
goals outlined by the United Nations global climate agreement struck in Paris in
2015.

One city jumping on the electric bus trend is Park City, Utah. In January, Park
City announced that it was buying six Proterra Catalyst shuttles and
establishing an electric rapid transit route in a resort community, the first of
its kind in the U.S.

HEADLINE: Investors Need a Better Green Filter

BYLINE: Joe McGrath



HIGHLIGHT: The firm has a checklist to help investors determine the green
credentials of fund managers.

 BODY:

Investors need better ways of evaluating a fund manager&s green credentials or
risk being seduced by investment strategies dressed up as
environmentally-friendly.

Consultants should ask whether firms are &walking the walk,& said Noel
O&Halloran, chief investment officer, at KBI Global Investors. He has a
checklist of considerations before a fund may be deemed truly environmentally
aware.

Investors should ensure firms are signatories to the United Nations& Principles
for Responsible Investment, ask to see their annual submission, and explore the
external organizations with which they have relationships, according to
O&Halloran.

His comments come ahead of the International Capital Market Association&s annual
Green Bond Principles conference in Paris on June 14. Green bonds & which aim to
produce returns from environmentally friendly investments & have fallen under
scrutiny as financial firms seek to justify their inclusion in their environment
funds.

France leads Europe in the sale of green bonds with $31.3 billion outstanding at
the end of last year, followed by Germany with $17.7 billion and the Netherlands
with $12.2 billion, according to a report last month from the Climate Bonds
Initiative.

Dutch bank DNB warned in a paper earlier this year that the growing appetite for
green bonds could be a trigger for firms to profile investments as &green& even
when they are not. DNB noted vast differences in how countries treat green
bonds, citing China as an example where &clean coal& companies can be financed
by them.

The &absence of generally accepted definitions and criteria& to assess whether
bonds are green hampers the credibility and the development of the market, DNB
said in the report.

Collaborative engagement is key to verifying a fund manager&s green credentials,
according to O&Halloran, who said that involvement with the Carbon Disclosure
Project, the UK Stewardship Code, the CDP Water Initiative, and the
Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, add creditability to an
investment firm&s commitment.

Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called for faster development
of the green-bond market to assist in reducing climate change risks for the
world economy. &The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity
to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring
growth,& he said in a speech in Berlin in September, as reported by Reuters at
the time.

Britain has just $1.2 billion of green bonds outstanding, according to the
Climate Bonds Initiative report.

HEADLINE: The Gentleman Activist

BYLINE: Imogen Rose-Smith



HIGHLIGHT: So long, poison-pen letters; hello, collaboration: Cliff Robbins ""
who cut his teeth in the ruthless world of 1980s leveraged buyouts "" has
emerged, however ironically, on the "nice" side of activism.

 BODY:

I am late, very late, very late indeed. But I have an excuse: time zones. I&m in
Los Angeles for the Milken Institute Global Conference, but my calendar is still
on East Coast time. At least, I thought it was.

This particular meeting, with Cliff Robbins, founder and CEO of $3.4 billion
hedge fund firm Blue Harbour Group, is set in my schedule for 10:30 a.m. I think
that means the meeting is really at 1:30 p.m. EST. Thus, 10:30 a.m. EST finds me
sitting in a breakout session of the conference, learning about climate change
(it&s bad, getting worse.)

Except 10:30 really means 10:30. By the time I realize this, after some polite
if urgent e-mailing from Robbins&s PR person, it&s closer to 11:30. There&s no
quick way for me to leave the session. When I finally make it out and take the
short elevator trip up to the fourth floor of the Beverly Hilton, where Robbins
is holding court in a suite secured for the duration of the conference, the
clock is inching closer to noon.

Robbins could be furious. This, after all, is Milken, a three-day marathon of
networking and schmoozing, hosted by the think tank founded by legendary trader
Michael Milken. Every half hour block is precious, and Robbins is an activist
investor, part of a group of fund managers hardly known for their lack of ego or
warm and friendly ways. Yet when I finally tumble through the door of his suite,
Robbins is all smiles.

For those who know Robbins, this wouldn&t come as a surprise. The American
investor is constitutionally and philosophically at odds with the image of the
alpha-male, my-way-or-the-­highway, flame-throwing activist hedge fund manager
that has come to dominate both the popular imagination of activist hedge funds
and, to a certain extent, the actual practice of hedge fund activism. Throughout
his hedge fund career, Robbins has styled himself as a &friendly& activist. He
likes to work with management to change a company and improve its performance.
&My approach all along has been just be honest and direct with people,& he says.
&We are respectful.&

For a gentleman activist, Robbins has a curious history, including a role in one
of the most notorious hostile takeovers of all time. A graduate of Harvard
University and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Robbins & who grew up
in Short Hills, New Jersey & joined private equity firm KKR & Co. in 1987 after
working in the M&A department of Morgan Stanley. It was the height of the
leveraged buyout boom, and KKR was embarking on its RJR Nabisco adventure.
Robbins played an important role in the deal & he even features in the
best-selling book on the buyout, Barbarians at the Gate & and served on RJR
Nabisco&s board for many years. He strongly disagrees with the suggestion that
KKR&s people were barbarians storming the walls of a storied company. Instead,
he says, the firm worked well with management and taught him the value of doing
so.

I know about Robbins&s KKR days, but I didn&t realize how well he had come to
know Milken. &When I was at KKR, I did a lot of work with him,& says Robbins,
referring to the man who almost single-handedly built the high-yield bond
market.

Robbins&s second major touchpoint with Milken is far more personal. Milken
survived prostate cancer and has made cancer one of the charitable causes with
which he is most closely associated. After Robbins&s own father was diagnosed
with cancer in the 1990s, Robbins reached out to Milken. Not only was Milken
extremely knowledgeable and helpful, he was a huge source of support, even
calling on weekends to see how Robbins and his family were coping. (Robbins&s
father recovered.) Robbins was at the first Milken Institute conference, held in
1997 with about 80 people in attendance, and has been coming back ever since.

The now-59-year-old Robbins left KKR in 1999 to join tech investor General
Atlantic, where he had worked as a summer associate more than a decade earlier.
He returned in the heady days of the internet, and he saw a new synergy between
venture capital and private equity, with larger companies looking to VC firms to
structure carve-outs for them to access the growing tech sector. After the 2001
dot-com crash and a series of corporate scandals, Robbins identified a new
opportunity. As a result of the scandals and ensuing reforms, he says, &boards
began listening to their large shareholders more than they ever had before, and
that kind of opened the door for our strategy.&

Launched in 2004 with $450 million in assets, Blue Harbour would be a different
type of activist investor. Instead of crafting poison-pen letters, it would work
with company management to improve profitability. It helps that Blue Harbour&s
targets are mostly middle-market companies.

&Companies in the $2 billion to $10 billion market cap segment are fertile for
our collaborative strategy because we&re welcomed as a resource,& says Robbins.
Businesses of that size &tend not to be well covered by investment banks and
sell-side research, and they often have more limited internal resources for
analyzing new strategies, so we usually find that they have not previously
considered the value-­unlocking ideas we bring to the table.& Blue Harbour takes
only a minority interest in companies and typically has about 15 stocks in its
portfolio at any one time, ten of which are core investments.

According to investors, Blue Harbour&s long-only strategy has an annualized
return of 10 percent since the firm&s founding. The strategy has been a
performer at a time when hedge funds in general & including some high-profile
activists & have been in a slump. Last year was particularly strong for Blue
Harbour, which returned 15.5 percent, compared with 5.44 percent for the HFRI
Fund Weighted Composite Index.

Institutional investors, some of which will not invest in more-hostile activist
firms for fear of the consequences of challenging publicly traded companies,
like Robbins&s approach. One prominent LP, the California State Teachers&
Retirement System, sees investing in Blue Harbour and a small handful of other
activist managers as a way of improving corporate governance & part of CalSTRS&
overall sustainable investment approach, which includes the consideration of ESG
(environmental, social and corporate governance) factors in relation to its
overall investment portfolio.

When Robbins and I met a few years ago, he spoke with great enthusiasm about
CalSTRS& governance program. In a March letter to investors, Robbins announced
that Blue Harbour was embracing a firmwide ESG strategy. Sitting in his LA hotel
suite, he wonders, &What took me so long?& Since the firm&s inception, Robbins
says, its leaders have thought of themselves as responsible investors. But &it&s
an evolving space,& he notes. &There is a lot of interest and pressure
building.& Appropriately, his panel session at Milken is on the topic of ESG.

Speaking of Milken, it&s time to get going. My half hour window has flown by.
Robbins&s suite looks down on the hotel patio; in the sun&s glare the conference
is in full swing. There are meetings to get to, sessions to attend, and
networking to be done. On schedule, if possible.

HEADLINE: Conventional Energy Investors Target Renewable Assets

BYLINE: Alicia McElhaney



HIGHLIGHT: Thirty-six percent of large institutional investors prefer renewable
assets to traditional energy such as oil, according to Preqin.

 BODY:

More than half of conventional energy investors are now putting money to work in
renewable resources.

Fifty-two percent are targeting renewable assets for their portfolios, according
to a Preqin report Thursday. The financial data provider said that large
institutional investors with more than $10 billion of assets are more likely to
prefer renewable resources in their holdings.

Traditional energy investors are allocating capital to renewable energy to
diversify their portfolios and keep up with increasing demand in emerging
economies, according to the report. It&s another sign that interest in
sustainable sources of energy is gaining momentum, a global shift that may not
be derailed by President Donald Trump&s decision to pull out of the Paris
Agreement battling climate change.

&Even though oil prices are low and traditional energy sources are cheaper, the
ship has sailed on renewables,& said Tyler Rosenlicht, vice president and
portfolio manager at real asset investment firm Cohen & Steers.

Emerging economies with large-scale energy projects aimed at improving living
standards will create investment opportunities in both renewable and
conventional energy, according to Preqin.

&Although the decision made by the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement
poses a challenge for the renewables industry in the U.S., the continued
commitments of other countries to this agreement is likely to result in
opportunities for fund managers and investors targeting these regions,& Preqin
said.

Renewable-focused funds have raised $5 billion this year, surpassing fundraising
for pools targeting conventional energy, according to a report earlier this
month from the data provider.

The stable returns that a diversified energy portfolio provides is likely
enticing investors to consider assets tied to oil and gas, as well as those in
solar or wind.

Energy funds that invest in both renewable and conventional energy perform
roughly on par with conventional energy investments and with less dispersion, or
difference between the best and worst performing investments, according to the
report released Thursday by Preqin.

Thirty-six percent of renewable energy investors with more than $10 billion
under management prefer renewable energy, the report shows. That includes 17
percent with more than $50 billion of assets.

A smaller percentage leans toward traditional energy. Twenty-eight percent of
institutional investors that manage more than $10 billion prefer conventional
energy investments, including 11 percent with more than $50 billion of assets,
according to Preqin.

Investments in energy, including renewable resources, will have to expand to
keep up with rising demand from a growing population, Rosenlicht said.
Otherwise, &how are you going to grow that supply?&

the European Long-Term Investment Funds regulation. Dahlén joined the Commission
in 2011.

Hermes Investment Management - The asset manager wholly owned by the BT Pension
Scheme has hired Orla Murphy as research director, a newly created role. She
will be responsible for procuring equity and credit research from brokers and
independent research providers. Hermes said Murphy would also be responsible for

the value of research.

Asset managers must disclose how much they pay for research under MiFID II
regulations by 3 January 2018 when the Europe-wide regulations come into force.

Murphy joins Hermes from VTB Capital, where she held roles including business
manager for international equities and cross-asset business manager. She has
also held business management and analysis positions at Barclays Wealth and
Fidelity Investments.

Legal & General - The insurance giant has appointed Pretty Sagoo as head of
strategic business within its pension risk transfer arm. She will oversee large
scheme pension buy-ins, buyouts, and longevity insurance transactions, L&G said.
She joins from Deutsche Bank where she led its insurance and pensions solutions

trustee of the Abbey Life Pension Scheme until November last year.

IIGCC - The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change has appointed Rachel
Ward as its head of EU policy. She joins from the UK's civil service where she
worked on EU and international climate change, energy, and transport policy for
10 years. In her new role she will identify and track key policy developments
and work to "strengthen [members'] collective voice, engagement and influence".

In addition, IIGCC has appointed Christina Olivecrona and Helena Viñes Fiestas
to its board. Olivecrona is a sustainability analyst at AP2, one of Sweden's
buffer funds for its public pension system. Fiestas is head of sustainability
research at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.

Ashburton Investments - The investment management firm has hired Robert Lea as
head of global equity research. He will lead a newly created research team,
which will provide analysis for the firm's equity and multi-asset funds. He
joins from UBS, where he was a global equity research sector head and
strategist. Ashburton has also appointed Jonathan Aldrich-Blake to the research
team - he was previously an investment manager at the firm.

Penfida - The UK advisory firm focused on sponsor covenant advice has appointed
a former chair of the country's pensions trade body as a senior adviser. Peter
Thompson joins from Bestrustees, an independent trustee firm, and previously
worked for Mercer for 25 years. Between 2001 and 2003 Thompson was chair of the
National Association of Pension funds (now the Pensions and Lifetime Savings
Association), part of an 11-year tenure at the trade body. He has also advised
organisations responsible for the UK's railways and universities on their
industry-wide pension provisions.

HEADLINE: ExxonMobil shareholders defy board in 'historic' climate change vote

BYLINE: Susanna Rust,



HIGHLIGHT: 62% of shareholders backed the climate change reporting resolution,
up from 38% last year

 BODY:

A majority of ExxonMobil shareholders voted in favour of a climate change
disclosure resolution despite the company urging them to oppose it, in sharp
contrast to the fate of a similar resolution filed by shareholders last year.

The resolution called on the company to report on how its portfolio of reserves
and resources would be affected by global efforts to limit the average rise in
temperatures to below 2° Celsius.

The company said it agreed with the importance of assessing the resiliency of
its resource portfolio, but recommended investors oppose the resolution as it
already conducted such assessments.

However, at the oil major's annual general meeting yesterday, some 62% of
shareholders rejected the board's recommendation by voting in favour of the
resolution, according to the Church Commissioners, which manages the Church of
England's £7.9bn (EUR9.2bn) endowment fund and co-filed the shareholder
resolution along with the New York Common Retirement Fund.

The filing also had the backing of a coalition of institutional investors with
some $5trn (EUR4.5trn) of assets under management, including the likes of Dutch
pension managers APG and MN.

Investors with a further EUR7trn of assets under management had pre-declared
their support for the shareholder resolution.

The outcome of the vote had nonetheless been keenly anticipated, in particular
to see how major US fund managers such as Vanguard and BlackRock would vote.

Last year the same resolution was supported by only 38% of shareholders, with
Vanguard and BlackRock having voted against, in line with the company's
recommendation.

A source following the ExxonMobil vote speculated that the 62% vote in favour of
this year's resolution suggested all three of the oil and gas major's largest
shareholders - Vanguard, BlackRock and StateStreet - had voted in favour of the
motion.

Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners, said
yesterday's vote was "historic".

"Despite strong opposition from the board, the majority of Exxon's shareholders
have sent an unequivocal signal to the company that it must do much more to
disclose the impact on its business of measures to combat climate change," he
said.

"We are grateful to all of the investors who supported the proposal, and we call
on the company to begin urgent engagement with shareholders on how to bring its
disclosures in line with those of its peers."

Mason previously argued that the outcome of last year's ExxonMobil shareholder
resolution underscored the need for a "cultural shift" among institutional
investors - especially large US asset managers - to become more willing to
challenge management.

The vote at ExxonMobil comes after recent majority votes at US fossil fuel
companies Occidental Petroleum and PPL Corporation, where a majority of
shareholders voted against the companies on climate change disclosure
resolutions. At Occidental, the motion was passed by 67%, thought to be a record
for a non-management backed shareholder resolution.

Raj Thamotheram, CEO at think tank Preventable Surprises, suggested the vote
helped make the case that the US's expected withdrawal from the Paris climate
change agreement - which president Donald Trump may announce today - will not
meaningfully undermine the investor-backed move towards a low-carbon economy.

Thamotheram said: "Investors voting against management at Exxon is a powerful
rebuke to the climate denialist policies of this White House. Markets are moving
and Corporate America would be foolish to bet so much on the protection from
this regime."

Representatives of campaign groups, investor groups, and energy economists also
hailed this year's vote at ExxonMobil as a significant development.

Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and
Financial Analysis, said the shareholder vote was "an exciting moment in
activist-investor history".

Fiona Reynolds, managing director of the Principles for Responsible Investment,
said: "More and more investors are facing up to the material risks around
climate change and they are not afraid to engage the companies in their
portfolios on this issue and demand answers on how these companies are preparing
to transition to a low carbon environment and the impact it will have on their
businesses."

Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a responsible investment
campaign organisation, said the resolution was "excellent news, marking a
step-change in investor sentiment for climate engagement".

HEADLINE: Trump ready to pull US out of climate deal says White House

BYLINE: Julie Pace

BODY:

Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord,
according to a White House official.

But the official said there may be "caveats in the language" the president uses
to announce the withdrawal, leaving open the possibility that the decision is
not final.

Nearly 200 nations, including the US, agreed in 2015 to voluntarily reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change.

During Mr Trump's overseas trip last week, European leaders pressed him to keep
the US in the landmark agreement.

He had promised during his presidential campaign to pull the US out of the deal.

Mr Trump, who has called global warming a "hoax", tweeted on Wednesday morning:
"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Withdrawing would leave the US aligned only with Russia among the world's
industrialised economies in rejecting action to combat climate change.

Word of Mr Trump's decision comes a day after he met Scott Pruitt, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Like his boss, Mr Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that
the Earth is warming and that man-made climate emissions are to blame.

Since taking office, the pair have moved to delay or roll back federal
regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive
long-struggling US coal mines.

What is not yet clear is whether Mr Trump plans to initiate a formal withdrawal
from the Paris accord, which under the terms of the agreement could take three
years, or exit the underlying UN climate change treaty on which the accord was
based.

The US is the world's second largest emitter of carbon, following only China.

Beijing, however, has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting its targets under the
Paris accord, recently cancelling construction of about 100 coal-fired power
plants and investing billions in massive wind and solar projects.

The news from the White House led to a swift and strong reaction from the United
Nations.

The UN's main Twitter page quotes secretary-general Antonio Guterres as saying:
"Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions
provide opportunities that are unmatchable."

The post includes a link to an impassioned speech Mr Guterres gave on Tuesday
when he called on the world to intensify action to combat climate change.

He said in the speech: "It would be very important for the US not to leave the
Paris agreement."

Social media baffled by 'covfefe' tweet

A midnight tweet from Donald Trump has sparked a social media quest to find a
meaning in the mysterious term "covfefe".

The president tweeted just after midnight local time time on Wednesday: "Despite
the constant negative press covfefe."

The tweet immediately went viral and became one of the president's more popular
posts.

He poked fun at the typo himself, tweeting around 6am: "Who can figure out the
true meaning of "covfefe" ??? Enjoy!"

Many on Twitter have supplied tongue-in-cheek meanings. One user joked that
"covfefe" is already a popular name for babies in states that voted for Mr
Trump.

Dozens of definitions have been submitted to the Urban Dictionary website, which
crowdsources meanings for slang terms.

Silicon Valley executive Andrew Crow went as far to change his last name on
Twitter to Covfefe.

Mr Trump's tweet was taken down after nearly six hours online, and the president
returned to his normal Twitter routine later in the morning.

HEADLINE: TD criticises 'crude' flood defence plan for Cork

BODY:

Cork North Central Solidarity TD Mick Barry has now backed calls for a tidal
barrier to future-proof the city from rising sea levels caused by global
warming.

I believe that the OPW proposals are crude and do not sufficiently take into
account the relationship of the people of the city with the river,  he said.

If implemented, I would be concerned that rising sea levels in future would
result in an  easy fix  by building the walls higher again.

He called for the OPW to give more consideration to alternative proposals put
forward by the Save Cork City (SCC) campaign group which has criticised the OPW
reliance on raised quay walls.

SCC has called for the construction of a tidal barrier at Little Island to
reduce tidal flood risk, and for a raft of upstream mitigation measures to
minimise fluvial flood risk.

SCC has costed its barrier at  135m but the OPW insisted this week that the
campaign group s figure doesn t take into account site investigation works and
complex engineering issues. The OPW says it stands over its tidal barrier
estimates of between  500m and  1bn.

But Mr Barry said:  I am concerned that the OPW cost estimates are being used as
a club with which to beat down dissent on this issue. I would like to see a
genuinely independent assessment as to the cost of constructing such a barrier.

He said he was impressed by arguments from climate change expert, Professor
Robert Devoy, who has suggested that a tidal barrier will need to be constructed
sooner rather than later given rising sea levels.

And he said Professor Philip O Kane s argument that strengthening the Inniscarra
dam combined with a tidal barrier and  slow the flow  initiatives upstream could
guarantee against flooding of the city, should also be considered.

SCC has criticised the OPW s dismissal of its tidal barrier estimate. The
barrier proposal is contained in its submission to the OPW.

HEADLINE: Trump ready to break climate deal

BODY:

DONALD Trump is expected to withdraw the US from a landmark global climate
agreement, a White House official has said, although aides are looking for
"caveats in the language" related to the exit and the decision is not yet final.

Abandoning the Paris deal would fulfil a central campaign pledge for the
president, but would anger international allies who spent years in difficult
negotiations that produced an accord to reduce carbon emissions. Mr Trump faced
considerable pressure to hold to the deal during meetings with European leaders
and Pope Francis on his recent trip abroad. The official said the president and
his staff were finalising the details of a pullout.

"I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Mr Trump tweeted yesterday. While he currently
favours an exit, he has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and
tends to seek counsel from a range of inside and outside advisers, many with
differing agendas, until the last minute.

His senior aides have been divided on the accord. Mr Trump is meeting secretary
of state Rex Tillerson, who has favoured remaining in the deal, while chief
strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, and senior adviser Jared Kushner
generally thinks the deal is bad, but would like to find a way to see if the US
emissions targets can be changed.

HEADLINE: Wyre Forest General Election hopefuls in their own words

BODY:

WITH the snap General Election just a week away, here are the five candidates
telling you why there deserve your vote on June 8.

Brett Caulfield - Green Party

"I promise you a different kind of politics for you and the people and places
that you love.

"I will campaign for your right to vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal,
including an option to stay in the EU to safeguard the rights for people and the
environment.

"I see urgent need for a major programme to build affordable houses. I also want
an NHS Reinstatement Act to roll back privatisation and ensure that health
services are publicly provided and funded.

"I will act on climate change and call for an Environmental Protection Act to
restore our environment and protect our wildlife. I will support a new Clean Air
Act to establish our children's right to breathe clean air.

"I will campaign for a Basic Universal Income and end exploitative zero hours
contracts. I will fight to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and
there is a crackdown on tax dodging.

"Our public transport system is shameful. We need buses and trains that are
affordable and reliable. We need to return the railways to public ownership and
re-regulate buses, investing in increased services especially in rural and other
poorly served areas.

"I believe that politics should be done by people, and not done to them, and
that's why I will work to introduce proportional representation, and why, as a
youth champion, I want the voting age lowered to 16."

George Connolly - UKIP

"I am a self-employed bricklayer, who works and lives in and around Wyre Forest.

"I'm trying to represent the people in the area that I have grown up with. I
love Wyre Forest and I really want to give something back. I know the people
here and I truly believe I am the best candidate to represent them and the
district in parliament.

"There is a problem of pubs closing in the area. Breweries should be given all
the help possible to thrive. Labours 'plan' would kill pubs through tax, while
thumping a few extra nails in their coffins as pub cos and publicans would be
condemned to penury by ever rising beer duty and unable to offload failed assets
due to a universal listing of pubs as assets of community value.

"We also have problems with car parking, particularly at Kidderminster Hospital.
UKIP have been strong advocates of free Hospital car parking for the last few
years. It is a disgusting money making scheme on the sick! We hear a lot about
national issues from other parties but not enough about what's happening right
here.

"I am the only candidate in Wyre Forest who on June 23, campaigned for Brexit!
63 per cent of the Wyre Forest constituency voted to leave, as a true
'Brexiteer' I will be their voice in the House of Commons if elected."

Mark Garnier - Conservative

"Few of us in Wyre Forest will ever forget how Labour let us down. Against huge
public objection, the last Labour government downscaled our hospital. Less known
is how much wider damage they did.

"Analysis of the ONS website reveals just how bad Labour have been for Wyre
Forest. In 2007, local workers received just 88p for each £1 their West Midlands
colleagues received. By 2010, for £1 paid to west midlands workers, we here in
Wyre Forest received just 77p. I've worked hard to redress that deficit. Now a
local worker is paid 84p per pound in the region - an average income of £26,000
yearly. Despite reducing unemployment from 2,500 in 2010 to around 800 now, we
need to do more.

"That is why I am pledging to bring more skills to Wyre Forest so workers can
get better paid jobs and our local economy will be more resilient to shocks. At
a time when we are entering Brexit negotiations, Labour wants to tax 3,500
businesses in Wyre Forest more, holding up investment and expansion.

"But it is not just about jobs and skills. We have successfully won more money
for Worcestershire schools, investment is coming into our hospitals. And we are
led by an individual who tackles the issues as they are, without making
undeliverable promises."

Matt Lamb - Labour

"My name is Dr Matt Lamb and I am Labour's Candidate. I want to build a fairer
Wyre Forest where prosperity and opportunity belongs to everyone, not just the
privileged few.

"I was raised in Kidderminster and educated at Comberton Middle, King Charles
and Kidderminster College. Following my Dad, who taught at Bewdley High School,
I have worked in education for the last 20 years and I am currently Assistant
Principal at Sandwell College. My partner Zoe is from Stourport and I have a 15
year old daughter, Angel.

"Wyre Forest needs a strong, independent voice to stand up for local interests.
The Tories have failed Wyre Forest. A crisis in the NHS has impacted on local
patients and families have seen a drop in living standards. A quarter of local
children live in poverty and there have been cuts to schools.

"Under Labour we can create a fairer society. We can ensure that jobs are secure
and well paid. We can ensure that our NHS and our schools get the money they
need. We can ensure that our young people can get a good education, a career and
a home. We can ensure dignity in old age. Wyre Forest deserves better."

Shazu Miah - Liberal Democrats

"This is the most important election of our lifetime. As a consequence of the
spring Budget, Wyre Forest schools will lose £4.2 million, 25,000 Pensioners
will lose a guaranteed annual increase of 2.5 per cent and mothers who wish to
access funds will have to prove that their child was born as result of rape.

"The Conservative manifesto now pledges to abolish free school meals which will
impact on over 25,000 children in Worcestershire, abolish fuel allowance for the
elderly and those who unfortunately have to receive care in their old age will
have to pay it by selling their house. Despite these cuts, the national debt has
risen.

"This week the IFS proclaimed that neither the Conservative party nor the Labour
Party "set out an honest set of choices" and that they were misleading the
public, whilst they found that my party the Liberal Democrats, were the most
transparent.

"Wyre Forest needs a strong opposition to these cuts. I will fight for fairer
funding in our schools, by reversing cuts and abolish plans for grammar schools.
I will fight to keep the triple lock and my party will save the NHS by asking
people to put an extra 1p in the pound to go directly to fund social care and
the NHS.

"On Brexit, my position is simple: trust the people and give them a say on the
final deal."

HEADLINE: Action is needed now to halt city's plague of rats;
Post: Liverpool ECHO, PO Box 48, Old Hall Street, Liverpool L69 3EB

BODY:

YOUR headline of May 29 about Kensington's rat infestation ("The rats aren't
scared any more") could well apply to many parts of Liverpool.

Quite a while ago, we heard of a commitment by Liverpool City Council to work
with United Utilities and repair collapsed back entries, an ideal nesting area
for the rodents.

Residents are unaware as to when, however, this work is supposed to take place
but, as United Utilities has just declared an increase of profits this year, up
to £622.9m, money shouldn't be the reason stopping the work going ahead.

Liverpool city council have increased the number of enforcement hit squads, but
it hasn't been advertised as to how many people have been caught, and fined, for
fly-tipping.

Finally, if the rats have nowhere to live, and nothing to eat, then council
baiting would be much more effective.

Such is the growth in the city's rat population, it will take a concerted effort
to drive down numbers, and the sooner the talking ends and the action begins,
the sooner residents will start to see an improvement in the situation.

Bernie Hunt, Kensington Fields Let's fly our flag WHY hasn't Liverpool got a
city flag? Liverpool is an internationally renowned city and port but, unlike
Hamburg, Amsterdam, Birmingham and many other world cities, it hasn't got a
flag. This is odd because the city is bursting with civic pride and it has such
a strong identity. It even has an entire museum devoted to its history and life.

Could the ECHO invite proposals for a city flag to be used by all? The designs
could be voted for and the best one could be submitted for registration with the
national flag body, The Flag Institute. Imagine seeing Liverpool's own flag
proudly flying at the riverside or from vessels. A flag would be a nice city
souvenir for citizens and tourists.

A flag could show the famous Liver Bird on a coloured background. It would be
tricky to use red or blue for this; those colours are too identified with local
football teams. Perhaps a purple background might work? Will someone pick up the
banner, please? Aidan Turner-Bishop, Preston Why vote Tory? BEFORE the Tories
won the last General Election, I wrote to the ECHO saying that, if people valued
public services, they should not vote for the Tory party, and if a person worked
in the public sector, like the NHS, police, etc, they would be like turkeys
voting for Chistmas.

It seems there were a lot of turkeys out there, because the Tories won. However,
I don't think even a turkey would vote for Christmas twice.

If you are one of the wealthy few, then vote Tory, they will see you all right.
But, if you are in the other 90%, why would you vote to have your spending power
further reduced? If you value the NHS, why would you vote to see it further run
down, perhaps never to recover? The Tories like to pretend they are the party of
economic prosperity, but in reality we all know they are the party of austerity
and welfare cuts, and we will all get another five years of the same if they get
in again. Pensioners will lose their winter fuel allowances and bus passes will
be next.

Imagine a country of affordable travel, lower energy bills and no more
austerity. The Tories have never felt the effects of austerity themselves, but
they like to impose it on others. S Howard, Liverpool Why keep quiet? I WATCHED
appalled over the weekend as the Tories and sections of the national press
attempted to smear both Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for supposedly supporting
IRA terrorism. On the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Marr questioned Diane Abbott
repeatedly, embarrassing her over a single quote she made over 30 years ago.

But now we have a situation reported by different media outlets that allege that
Prime Minister Theresa May, when she was Home Secretary in 2011, apparently
allowed suspected Libyan al-Qaida terrorists, who were under police control
orders, to go and fight against the Libyan government of Colonel Gaddafi. Then
they were allowed to return to the UK. Many, like the terrorist Salman Abedi,
lived in Manchester.

I was wondering why the Labour Party are allowing these untruths to be made
against themselves while saying nothing about Theresa May's possible collusion
with Libyan terrorists? Mark Holt, Brighton-le-Sands Fight poverty DURING this
election campaign, I am concerned with who will represent us in the next
Parliament. There are many important local and national issues at stake.

As a supporter of Catholic aid agency CAFOD, I hope that candidates of all
parties will consider global issues, too, and commit to build on Britain's proud
record in looking outwards and working with others to tackle poverty, inequality
and climate change.

We live in an interconnected world. To say we can't help people at home if we
help those abroad is to present a false choice. We are big enough to do both: it
is who we are and what we stand for.

Mrs K Lyons, L23 Diabetes event A DIABETES event will be taking place tomorrow
(10am - noon) at The Friday Morning Community Café, St David's Church, Rocky
Lane.

The Friday Café, which is supported by Childwall councillors Frank Hont, Liz
Parsons and myself, has run successfully for more than three years. With our
help, it has introduced a monthly community event on the first Friday of each
month.

At the Diabetes event on June 2, attendees will get the chance to find out their
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and receive support to reduce their risk.

Furthermore, attendees will be offered the opportunity to get involved in their
local community, ask any questions they may have and talk to others living with
the condition.

The Liverpool Diabetes Partnership will be present to offer its expertise and
there will be lots of information for people to take away.

We thank Diabetes UK for helping to organise this event.

We look forward to seeing many members of the local community on June 2. Cllr
Jeremy Wolfson, Labour councillor for Childwall

Imagine seeing Liverpool's own flag proudly flying at the riverside or from
vessels. A flag would be a nice city souvenir for citizens and tourists Aidan
